            <p>, a learned divine of the Lutheran persuasion, was born at Zwolle, a town of Overyssel, in 1718, and was a preacher in the Lutheran church at Haerlem for fifty-one years, where his public and private character entitled him to the highest esteem. His favourite motto, “<q>God is love,</q>” was the constant rule of his pastoral conduct. In 1752, he had the chief hand in establishing the Haerlem Society of Sciences, and in 1778 formed a separate branch for the study of Œconomics. In both he acted as secretary for many years; and, besides some Sermons, published, in the Transactions of that Society, a variety of scientific papers. He died at Haerlem in 1795.</p>

            <p>, lord of Someldyck and Spyck, one of the most celebrated negociators of the United Provinces, was the son of Cornelius Aarsens, (who was greffier, or secretary of state, from 1585 to 1623,) and was born at the Hague in 1572. His father put him under the care of Duplessis Mornay at the court of William I. prince of Orange. The celebrated John Barnevelt sent him afterwards as agent into France; and, after residing there some time, he was recognised as ambassador, the first whom the French Court had received in that capacity from the United States; and the king, Louis <sc>XIII</sc>. created him a knight and baron. After holding this office for fifteen years, he became obnoxious to the French Court, and was deputed to Venice, and to several German and Italian princes, on occasion of the troubles in Bohemia. But such was the dislike the French king now entertained against him, that he ordered his ambassadors in these courts not to receive his visits. One cause of this appears to have been a paper published by Aarsens in 1618, reflecting on the French king’s ministers. In 1620 he was sent as ambassador to England, and again in 1641: the object of this last embassy was to negociate a marriage between prince William, son to the prince of Orange, and a daughter of Charles I. Previous to this, however, we find him again In France, in 1624, as ambassador extraordinary, where it appears that he became intimate with and subservient to the cardinal Richelieu; who used to say that he never knew but three great politicians, Oxenstiern, chancellor of Sweden, Viscardi, chancellor of Montferrat, and Francis Aarsens. His character, however, has not escaped just censure, on account of the hand he had in the death of Barnevelt, and of some measures unfriendly to the liberties of his country. He died in 1641. The editors of the Diet. Historique attribute to him “<q date="1666">A Journey into Spain, historical and political,</q>” published by De Sercy at Paris, <date event="work">1666</date>, 4to, and often reprinted; but this was the work of a grandson, of both his names, who was drowned in his passage from England to Holland, 1659.</p>

            <p> was born at Riez in Provence, in
                1648. He removed to Paris early in life, where he was
                much admired for the brilliancy of his wit. The marechai de Luxembourg took notice of him, and gave him
                the title of his secretary; and the poet followed the hero
                in his campaigns. The marshal gave him his confidence during his life, and at his death recommended him
                to his heirs as an estimable man. The prince of Conti and
                the duke de Vendome vouchsafed him their familiarity, and
                found great pleasure in his lively and animated conversation. The witticisms which would have been common in
                the mouth of any other man, were rendered striking in him
                by the turn he gave them, and by the grimaces with which
                he accompanied them. A countenance remarkably ugly
                and full of wrinkles, which he managed at pleasure, stood
                him instead of a variety of masks. Whenever he read a
                tale or a comedy, he made a ludicrous use of this moveable physiognomy for distinguishing the personages of the
                piece he was reciting. The abbe Abeille enjoyed a priory,
                and a place in the French academy. We have of him
                some odes, some epistles, several tragedies, one comedy,
                and two operas. A certain prince observed of his tragedy
                of Cato, that, if Cato of Utica should return from the
                grave, he would be only the Cato of the abbe Abeille.
                He understood well enough what was necessary to the formation of a good poet: but he was not one himself. His
                style is feeble, low, and languid. In his versification he
                discovers none of that dignity he had in his character. He
                died at Paris, the 21st of May, 1718. A French critic,
                speaking of the two tragedies, Solyman and Hercules,
                written by Jean Juvenon de la Thuiilerie, says, the reader
                will be able to judge of their merit, when he is informed
                that they were attributed to the Abbé Abeille .</p>

                theological studies at Halberstadt, under the celebrated
                Mosheim, and a year after removed to Halle, where he
                attended the lectures of Wolfe and Baumgarten, and often
                preached with much applause. In a few years, however,
                he gave up his theological pursuits, studied medicine, and
                in 1744 was admitted to the degree of doctor at Konigsberg. On his return to Halberstadt, he practised as a physician above half a century, and died Nov. 23, 1794. He
                is said to have been uncommonly successful in practice,
                yet had very little faith in medicine, and always prescribed
                such remedies as were cheap and common. Probity, modesty, and humanity, were the most striking features in
                his character. While studying medicine at Halle, he did
                not neglect polite literature. He made some poetical translations, particularly one of Juvenal into German, which he

                which he resigned about three years afterwards, in order to
                live a retired life in the house of St. Lazare, at Paris. He
                died Oct. 4, 1691, aged 88 years. His principal works
                are: 1. “<q>Medulla Theologica,</q>” 2 vols. 12mo, which
                gained him the title of Modleuz A belli (the marrowy) from
                Boileau. 2. A treatise “<q>De la Hierarchic, et de l'autorité du Pape,</q>” 4to. 3. “<q date="1662">La Tradition de l'Eglise, touchant

                French writings are accounted by his countrymen flat and
                insipid. They allow him, however, to have excelled in

                1099, called by the Jews, the wise, great, and admirable
                doctor, was a very able interpreter of the Holy Scriptures,
                and was well skilled in grammar, poetry, philosophy, astronomy, and in medicine. He was also a perfect master of
                the Arabic. His style is in general clear, elegant, concise,
                and much like that of the Holy Scriptures; he almost
                always adheres to the literal sense, and everywhere gives
                proofs of his genius and good sense: he however advances some erroneous sentiments, and his conciseness
                sometimes makes his style obscure. He travelled in
                most parts of Europe, visiting England, France, Italy,
                Greece, &amp;c. for the purpose of acquiring knowledge,
                and far surpassed his brethren both in sacred and profane

                or a commentary on the Law, fol. Constantinople, 5262

            <p>, a physician and historian,
                was the son of Alexander Abercromby, of Fetternear, in
                Aberdeenshire, and brother of Francis Abercromby, who
                was created lord Glasford in July 1685. He was born at
                Forfar, in the county of Angus, in 1656, and educated in
                the university of St. Andrew’s, where he took the degree
                of doctor in medicine in 1685. Some accounts say that
                he spent <csc>Ims</csc> youth in foreign countries, was probably educated in the university of Paris, and that his family were
                all Roman Catholics, who partook of the misfortunes of
                James <sc>II</sc>.; others, that on his return to Scotland he renounced the Protestant religion, at the request of king
                James, and was by him appointed one of the physicians to
                trie court, which he was obliged to relinquish at the Revolution. Soon after he attached himself to the study of
                antiquities, and published, “<q>The Martial Achievements
                    of Scotland,</q>” 2 vols. fol. 1711 and 1715, to which he was
                encouraged by a large list of subscribers. The first volume
                abounds in the marvellous, but the second is valuable on
                account of its accurate information respecting the British
                history in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. He
                wrote also a treatise on Wit, 1686, which is now little
                known, and translated M. Beague’s very rare book,
                “<q date="1556">L‘Histoire de la Guerre d’Escosse,</q>” <date event="work">1556</date>, under the

                between France and Scotland is strenuously asserted in

                Mr. Chalmers, or, as in the last edition of this Dictionary,
                in 1726, about the age of 70, or rather 72.
            </p>
            <p>In the former edition of this work it is said that he never
                made any distinguished figure in the physical profession.
                There was, however, a <csc>David</csc> 
                <csc>Abercromby</csc>, a contemporary and countryman of his, who published in London some

                Paris, <date event="work">1623</date>, 8vo. These notes were from the pen of our
                author. He published also a Hebrew grammar in Latin
                verse, and translated into French Bartoli’s Italian pieces,
                “<q>The Life of Vinant Caraffa;</q>” “<q>The Man of Letters,</q>” and
                “<q>Contented Poverty.</q>” As an original writer he is uncommonly prolix, but displays much learning and acuteness.
                Bayle gives most praise to his commentary on Cicero, by
                which Osorius and Olivet profited much; but others prefer
                his Pharus. It may be necessary to add what is meant by bis
                taking the fourth vow. In addition to the vows of poverty,
                chastity, and obedience, the fourth is, that the person taking
                it shall labour to promote the salvation of others, by instructing youth, preaching, administering the sacraments, and by
                becoming missionaries among heretics and idolaters.</p>

                there, as the caliph Haroun Al Raschid would have him
                near his person at Bagdad, and gave him an apartment in
                his palace with Abou-Massaab and Rekashi, two other excellent poets. His principal works have been collected
                into a body, called by the Arabians a Diwan t or volume,

            <p> was of an illustrious family,
                being descended on the father’s side from Justin, nephew
                to Justinian emperor of Constantinople, and also from the
                dukes of Athens, Bohemia, and Corinth. His ancestors
                bad enjoyect very honourable posts in the kingdom of
                Naples, and had also been viceroys of Sicily, and generals.
                Some of them had filled very high employments in the republic of Florence, had been ambassadors to several powers
                of Europe, were related to all the princes of the Morea
                and adjacent islands, raised to the dignity orcardinal; and
                had erected several splendid Carthusian monasteries in Florence, Naples, &amp;c. Our author, the son of Neri Acciaioli
                and Lena Strozzi, was born at Florence in 1428. His first
                preceptors were James Ammanati, afterwards cardinal of
                Pavia, and Leonard d'Arezzo. He afterwards studied
                Greek under Argyropilus, and became one of the first
                Greek scholars of his time. He was one of the celebrated
                literary parties at which Lorenzo de Me.lici presided. Excelling in rhetoric, philosophy, and mathematics, he would
                have attained a very high rank in the republic of letters,
                if his weak state of health, and the part he took in the
                affairs of his country, had not interrupted his studies. He
                filled several employments in the state, and gave universal
                satisfaction. In 1475 he was gonfalonier, or ensign of
                the republic, and died in 1478 at Milan, when on his way
                to Paris as ambassador from the Florentines. This circumstance was a subject of the sincerest grief to the Florentines, who well knew how to appreciate the virtues of
                their fellow-citizens, and omitted no opportunity of inciting the patriotism of the living, by the honours they
                bestowed on the memory of the dead. A sumptuous funeral was decreed to his remains, which were brought to
                Florence for that purpose. Lorenzo de Medici and three
                other eminent citizens were appointed curators of his
                children, and the daughters had considerable portions assigned them from the public treasury. The celebrated
                Angelo Politian wrote his epitaph, and Christopher Landino pronounced the funeral oration. His works are:
                1. “<q date="1478">Expositio super libros Ethicorum Aristotelis, in novam

                translated the lives of Alcibiades and Demetrius, and added
                to the same collection those of Hannibal and Scipio from
                his own pen, with a life of Charlemagne. 4. “<q date="1473">The Latin

            <p>, probably
                of the same family with the preceding, was born at Florence
                in 1461, and having been banished in his infancy with his
                relations, was recalled when about 16 years of age by Lorenzo the magnificent, and educated by his directions with
                Lorenzo, the son of Pier-Francesco de Medici, to whom
                Zanobio was nearly related. He became very eminent as
                a Greek and Latin scholar, and had much intercourse with
                Angelo Politian, Marsilius Ficinus, and other eminent
                Florentine scholars. After the death of Lorenzo the
                magnificent, he became disgusted with the commotions
                which agitated his native place, and devoting himself to
                a monastic life, received fiom the famous Savonarola, about
                1494, the habit of a Dominican. At this time he studied
                Hebrew with great industry; but his chief employment was
                the examination of the Greek manuscripts in the library of
                the Medici, and in that of St. Mark at Florence. On the
                elevation of Leo X. he went to Rome, and was enrolled
                by Leo among his constant attendants, with an honourable
                stipend, and a residence in the oratory of S. Silvestro. In
                1518 Leo appointed him librarian to the Vatican, where
                he undertook the laborious task of selecting and arranging
                the ancient public documents, of which he formed an index, published since by Montfaucon, in his Bibl. Biblio-ithecarum <csc>Mss</csc>. vol. I. p. 202. His industry probably
                shortened his days, as he did not long enjoy his office,
                having died July 27, 1519, and not 1536, as Fabricius
                asserts. Saxius gives 1520 as the date.
            </p>
            <p>While attending a general chapter of his order at Naples
                in 1515, he made an oration in Latin in praise of the city
                of Naples, which he afterwards published. He also translated into Latin, Eusebius of Caesarea, Olympiodorus, and
                Theodoret, and is supposed to have been the translator of
                the greater part of the works of Justin Martyr. Among
                his remaining works is an oration in praise of the city of
                Rome, printed in 4to, without place, printer, or date; but
                the dedication to the cardinal Julio de Medici is dated 26
                May 1518. In 1495 he published Politian’s Greek epigrams, which were recommended to his care by the author
                in his last moments. He translated also into Latin verse
                the Greek address of Marcus Musurus to Leo X. prefixed
                to the first edition of Plato. Giraldi, in his first dialogue
                “<q>De Poetis nostrorum temporum,</q>” admits him among the
                good poets of his age; and others have bestowed great applause on his verses, a specimen of which may be seen in
                the work first quoted below.</p>

            <p>, an eminent lawyer and historian of the fifteenth century, and the first of that ancient
                Tuscan family who acquired a name for literary talents,
                was born at Arezzo, in 1415. His father was Michel
                Accolti, a civilian of Florence, and his mother a daughter
                of Roselli of Arezzo, also a lawyer. After a classical
                education, he studied the civil law, and was made professor
                at Florence, where his opinions acquired him much popularity. The Florentines, after conferring on him the rights
                of citizenship, chose him in 1459 to be secretary of the
                republic, in the room of Poggius, which office he retained
                until his death in 1466. The account of his transactions
                in public affairs are preserved in four books, with a great
                collection of his letters to foreign princes, which evince
                his sagacity as a statesman, and his politeness as a writer.
                He married Laura Frederigi, the daughter of a lawyer and
                patrician of Florence, by whom he had a numerous family,
                of whom Bernard and Peter will be noticed hereafter. His
                memory is said to have been so retentive, that on one
                occasion, after hearing the Hungarian ambassador pronounce a Latin address to the magistrates of Florence, he
                repeated the whole word for word. -His inclination for the
                Study of history made him relax in the profession of the
                law, and produced: 1. “<q date="1532">De bello a Christianis contra Barbaros gesto, pro Christi sepulchre et Judaea recuperandis,
                    libri quatuor,</q>” Venice, <date event="work">1532</date>, 4to, and reprinted at Basle,
                Venice, and Florence, the latter edition with notes by
                Thomas Dempster, 1623, 4to, and at Groninguen, by Henry
                Hoffnider, 1731, 8vo. It was also translated into Italian,
                by Francis Baldelli, and printed at Venice, 1549, 8vo. Yves
                Duchat of Troyes in Champagne, translated it into
                French and Greek, and printed it at Paris, 1620, 8vo. This
                is a work of considerable historical credit, and in the succeeding century, served as a guide to TorquatoTasso, in his
                immortal poem, the Gerusalemme liberata. It was dedicated
                to Piero de Medici, and not to Cosmo, as Moreri asserts.
                Paulo Cortesi, a severe censor, allows that it is a work of
                great industry, and that it throws considerable light on a
                very difficult subject. A more recent critic objects to the purity of his style, and the length of the speeches he puts in
                the mouths of his principal personages. 2. “<q date="1689">De praestantia

            <p>, the brother of Benedetto, and
                usually called <csc>Francis</csc> D'<csc>Arezzo</csc>, or <csc>Aretin</csc>, from the
                place of his birth, was born in 1418. The celebrated
                Francis Philelphus was his preceptor in polite learning;
                after which he studied law under the ablest professors,
                and became himself one of their number, teaching that
                faculty at Bologna, Ferrara, and Sienna. He was for five
                years secretary to the duke of Milan, and died of the
                stone at the baths of Sienna, in 1483. He has been accused, but without proof, of the grossest avarice. If he
                left vast wealth, it was owing to the profits of his profession, of which he was acknowledged to be the ablest and
                most successful practitioner. A journey which he made
                to Rome, when Sixtus <sc>IV</sc>. was Pope, has given rise to
                another story, equally without proof, that he solicited to
                be made Cardinal, which the Pope refused, on pretence
                of the injury that would accrue to learning from such a
                promotion. Another story is recorded, more to his honour.
                While professor of law at Ferrara, he had occasion to lecture to his scholars on the advantages of a character known
                for probity and honour; and, in order to exemplify his
                doctrine, he went in the night, accompanied by only one
                servant, broke open the butchers’ stalls, and took away
                some pieces. The law-students were immediately suspected of the robbery, and two of them, of indifferent
                character, were imprisoned. The Professor then went
                before the Duke, demanded their release, and accused
                himself: having proved the fact, which was with difficulty
                believed, he took the opportunity to show the advantage
                of a good character, and the dangers of a bad one.</p>
            <p>He left several works. The principal are 1. “<q date="1470">S. Chrysostomi homilias in Evangelium- S. Joannis, interprete F.A.</q>”
                Rome, <date event="work">1470</date>, fol. Erasmus is of opinion that this translation is deficient in fidelity, anJ that the author was not
                sufficiently acquainted with the Greek language. 2. “<q date="1469">Phalaridis Epistolae,</q>” Rome, about <date event="work">1469</date>, 8vo; afterwards
                re-printed in 1471, 1474, 1475. 3. “<q>Diogenis Cynici

                Some writers, not attending to the title of this work, have
                considered him as the author of it. 5. “<q>Consilia seu Responsa,</q>” Pisa, a collection of consultations on questions
                of law. 6. “<q>Commentaria super Lib. <sc>II</sc>. Decretalium,</q>”

                also cultivated Italian poetry, and the libraries of Chigi and
                Strozzi contain several of his poetical pieces in manuscript. Crescembini inserted some of his sonnets in his
                history of Italian poetry. His Latin letters are in the Ambrosian library at Milan.</p>

                law at Pisa, where he became doctor arid professor. He
                afterwards went into the church, was promoted to the
                bishoprick of Ancona, and six years after, to be Cardinal,
                under the title of St. Eusebius, hut is better known by the
                title of Cardinal of Ancona. He afterwards held seven
                bishopricks in Spain, Flanders, France, and Italy; and
                attained the higher honours of cardinal-vicar and legate.
                He died at Rome Dec. 12, 1532, aged 77; and left some
                works on law of no great importance. He was the author
                of the bull against Luther, which condemned forty-one
                propositions or that reformer. One of his natural sons,
                Benedict Accolti, was, in 1564j the chief of the Florentine
                conspiracy against Pius <sc>IV</sc>. for which he was executed.</p>

            <p>, an eminent
                lawyer, who first collected the various opinions and decisions of his predecessors, in the Roman law, into one body,
                was born at Florence, in 1151, or, according to some
                writers, in 1182. He was the scholar of Azzo, and soon
                became more celebrated than his master. Yet it is thought
                that he did not begin the study of law before he was forty
                years old. When professor at Bologna, he resigned his
                office in order to complete a work on the explanation of
                the laws, which he had long meditated, and in which he
                was now in danger of being anticipated by Odefroy.  By
                dint of perseverance for seven years, he accumulated the
                vast collection known by the title of the “<q>Great Gloss,</q>”
                or the “<q>Continued Gloss</q>” of Accursius. He may be considered as the first of glossators, and as the last, since no one
                has attempted the same, unless his son Cervot, whose
                work is not in much esteem; but he was deficient in a
                proper knowledge of the Greek and Roman historians,
                and the science of coins, inscriptions, and antiquities,
                which are frequently necessary in the explanation of the
                Roman law. On this account, he was as much undervalued
                by the learned lawyers of the fourteenth and sixteenth
                centuries, as praised by those of the twelfth and thirteenth,
                who named him the Idol of Lawyers. They even established it as a principle, that the authority of the Glosses
                should be universally received, and that they should rally
                round this perpetual standard of truth. The different studies pursued in the ages of Accursius’ friends and enemies,
                will account for their different opinions of his merits; the
                one consisted of accumulated learning, interpretation, and
                commentary, the other approached nearer to nature and
                facts, by adding the study of antiquities, and of the Greek
                and Latin historians. Another reason probably was, that
                Accursius, who has been careless in his mode of quotation,
                became blamed for many opinions which belong to Irnerius, Hugolinus, Martinus Bulgarus, Aldericus, Pileus, &amp;c.
                and others his predecessors, whose sentiments he has not
                accurately distinguished. The best edition of his great
                work is that of Denis Godefroi, Lyons, 1589, 6 vols. fol,
                Of his private life we have no important materials. He
                lived in splendour at a magnificent palace at Bologna,
                or at his villa in the country; and died in his 78th year, in
                1229. Those who fix his death in 1260 confound him
                with one of his sons of the same name. All his family,
                without exception, studied the law; and he had a daughter, a lady of great learning, who gave public lectures ou
                the Roman law in the university of Bologna. Bayle doubts
                this; but it is confirmed by Pancirollus, Fravenlobius, and
                Paul Freyer. The tomb of Accursius, in the church of
                the Cordeliers at Bologna, is remarkable only for the
                simplicity of his epitaph “<q>Sepnlchrum Accursii glossatoris legum, et Francisci ejus filii.</q>”</p>

            <p>, a learned Prussian divine, was
                born at Geneva in 1696, took orders in 1722, and in 1724
                was promoted to the church of Werder in Berlin. He enjoyed the protection of the prince-royal of Prussia; and
                having in 1730 accompanied the son of M. de Finkenstein
                to Geneva, was admitted into the society of pastors.
                Eight years after, the king of Prussia appointed him counsellor of the supreme consistory, and in 1740, a member
                of the French directory, with the title of Privy-counsellor.
                Having been received into the academy of Berlin in 1743,
                he was also appointed inspector of the French college, and
                director of the Charity-house. He died in 1772. He was
                long the correspondent of the Jesuits Colonia, Tournemine, Hardouin, Poreus, and of father Le Long, and
                Turretine, Trouchin, and Vernet of Geneva. He often
                preached before the royal family of Prussia; and such were
                his powers of oratory, that a celebrated French comedian at Berlin, who there taught the theatrical art, recommended his pupils to hear Achard. He was of a very
                feeble constitution, and for twenty years subsisted entirely
                on a milk-diet. In the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin,
                for 1745, there is the outline of a very considerable work,
                in which he proves the liberty of the human mind against
                Spinosa, Bayle, and Collins. Two volumes of “<q>Sermons
                    sur divers textes de l'Ecriture Sainte,</q>” were published at
                Berlin after his death.
            </p>
            <p>His son <csc>Francis</csc>, born at Berlin in 1753, a member of
                several academies, has furnished many dissertations for
                the Literary Journal of Berlin, and other Memoirs of
                learned societies. Senebier in his literary history of Geneva gives a list of all his pieces, and a collection of them
                was published in German, in two volumes.</p>

            <p> was
                born at Avignon, Jan. 29, 1679, of a noble and ancient
                family. After having embraced the ecclesiastical profession, he became not only distinguished by the excellence
                of his doctrines, but particularly by his charitable exertions
                during the plague in 1721; and his subsequent promotions
                had no other effect on him than to increase his zeal and
                his piety. Pope Clement <sc>XII</sc>. informed of his talents and
                conciliating spirit, employed him in the capacity of apostolic vicar, to settle the disgraceful disputes that had arisen
                among the missionaries of China. Achards, who was then
                bishop of Halicarnassus, undertook this commission; and
                after a tedious voyage of two years, and two years’ resi-r
                dence in China, where he ineffectually laboured to accomplish the object of his mission, died at Cochin, April 2,
                1741, a martyr to his indefatigable and benevolent zeal.
                The Abbe Fab re, his secretary, published an account of
                this mission, entitled “<q>Lettres edifiantes et curieusessurla

            <p>, an eminent painter,
                was born at Cologne, in 1556, of a good family. He
                discovered a taste for his art from his earliest years, and at
                the age of eleven, painted a portrait with such success, as
                to induce his parents to encourage his studies. After having been for some time taught by a very indifferent painter, he became the disciple of de Georges, or Jerrigh, a
                good portrait-painter, with whom he remained six years;
                and afterwards improved himself by studying and copying
                the works of Spranger. In his twenty-second year he went
                to Italy, and was introduced at Venice to a Flemish artist,
                named Gaspard Reims. This man no sooner learned that
                Van Achen was a German, than he recommended him to
                an Italian who courted necessitous artists that he might
                make, a trade of their labours. With him Van Achen
                made some copies, but, being unable to forget the reception which Reims had given him, he painted his own portrait, and sent it to him. Reims was so struck with the performance, that he apologized to Van Achen, took him
                into his house, and preserved the portrait all his life with
                great veneration. At Venice, he acquired the Venetian
                art of colouring, and thence went to Rome to improve his
                design, but never quitted the mannered forms of Spranger.
                His best performances at Rome were a Nativity for the
                church of the Jesuits, and a portrait of Madona Venusta,
                a celebrated performer on the lute. His talents, however,
                and polite accomplishments, recommended him to several
                of the greatest princes of Europe, and particularly to the
                elector of Bavaria, and the emperor Rodolph, by both of
                whom he was patronized and honoured. He was one of
                that set of artists who, in the lapse of the sixteenth century, captivated Germany and its princes by the introduction of a new style, or rather manner, grossly compounded from the principles of the Florentine and Venetian schools. He died at Prague in 1621.</p>

            <p>, a native of Bologna, where
                he was born Oct. 29, 1463, was a philosopher and physician,
                and professed both those sciences with great reputation. He
                had scholars from all parts of Europe. He died in his own
                country, August 2, 1512, at the age of 40, with the surname of The great philosopher, after having published various pieces in anatomy and medicine. To him is ascribed
                the discovery of the little bones in the organ of hearing'.
                He adopted the sentiments of Averroes, and was the rival
                of Pomponacius. These two philosophers mutually decried each other, and Pomponacius had generally the advantage, as he had the talent of mixing witticisms with his
                arguments, for the entertainment of the by-standers, while
                Achillini lowered himself with the public by his singular
                and slovenly dress. His philosophical works were printed
                in one vol. folio, at Venice, in 1508, and reprinted with
                considerable additions in 1545, 1551, and 1568. His principal medical works are: 1. “<q date="1520">Annotationes Anatomies,</q>”
                Bonon. <date event="work">1520</date>, 4to, and Venice, 1521, 8vo. 2. “<q date="1521">De humani corporis Anatomia,</q>” Venice, <date event="work">1521</date>, 4to. 3. “<q>In
                    Mundini anatomiam annotationes,</q>” printed with Kathaiifs

                Achillini also cultivated poetry; but if we may judge
                from some verses in the collection published on the death
                of the poet Seraphin dall' Aquila, not with much success.</p>

                died in 1558. He was learned in the Greek and Latio
                languages, in theology, philosophy, and music, and the study
                of law and antiquities, but is most celebrated as a
                poet, although his works are not free from the faults peculiar to his age. Yet he gave even these a turn so peculiarly original, that they appear to have been rather his
                own than acquired by imitation. He published, among
                many other works: 1. A scientific and moral poem, written in the ottava rima, entitled “<q>
                    <sc>II</sc> Viridario,</q>” Bologna,
                4to, which contains eulogiums on many of his learned contemporaries. 2. “<q>
                    <sc>II</sc> Fedele,</q>” also in heroics. These are
                both scarce, as they never were reprinted. 3. “<q>Annotazioni della lingua volgare,</q>” Bologna, 1.536, 8vo. This
                was intended as an answer to those who complained of the
                provincialisms in his style. 4. He also published a collection of poems pu the death of Seraphin dall' Aquila, mentioned in the preceding article, Bologna, 1504, 4to. He
                has more stretch of mind than most of his contemporaries.</p>

                lettres, and philosophy, he entered on the study of the
                law, and prosecuted it with so much success, that he was
                honoured with a doctor’s degree at the age of twenty,
                Dec. 16, 1594, and became a professor of that science at
                Bologna, Ferrara, and Parma, where he acquired great
                reputation. His learning was so much admired that an
                inscription to his honour was put up in the public schools,
                and both popes and cardinals gave him hopes, which were
                never realized, of making his fortune. Towards the end
                of his life he lived principally in a country house called <sc>II</sc>
                Sasso, and died there Oct. 1, 1640. His body was carried to Bologna, and interred in the tomb of his ancestors
                in the church of St. Martin. He is principally known now
                by his poetry, in which he was an imitator of Marino, and
                with much of the bad taste of his age. It has been asserted
                that he received a gold chain worth a thousand crowns
                from the court of France, for a poem on the conquests of
                Louis <sc>XIII</sc>.; but this reward was sent him by the Cardinal
                Richelieu, in consequence of some verses he wrote on the
                birth of the dauphin. His poems were printed at Bologna,
                1632, 4to, and were reprinted with some prose pieces,
                under the title “<q date="1651">Rime e Prose,</q>” Venice, <date event="work">1651</date>, 12mo.</p>

            <p>, a physician and medical writer of considerable note in Germany,
                and professor of medicine at Altdorf, in Franconia, was
                born in 1756, at Zeulenrode, in Upper Saxony. His
                father was a physician, and initiated his son in that science
                at a very early age. When scarcely fifteen, he prescribed
                with success to many of his friends daring a dangerous epidemic which prevailed at Otterndorf. He afterwards finished his studies at Jena and Gottingen, under Baldinger,
                and became a very excellent classical scholar under the
                celebrated Heyne. After having practised medicine in his
                own country for some years, and distinguished himself by
                various translations of Italian, French, and English works,
                as well as by his original compositions, he was appointed
                to the professorship at Altdorf. He was also a member of
                various medical societies; and his practice is said to have
                been as successful, as his theory of disease was sound. He
                died at Altdorf in 1801. His principal works are: 1. “<q>Institutiones Historiae Medicinse,</q>” Nuremberg, 17.'J2, 8vo.
                2. “<q>A Manual of Military Medicine,</q>” 2 vols. 8vo, Leipsic,

                could speak Hebrew. He died Nov. 4, 1704. His most
                celebrated works are some chapters of a polyglot Koran,
                which he intended to have completed. The specimen,
                which is very scarce, is “<q date="1701">Tetrapla Alcoranica, sive Specimen Alcorani quadrilinguis Arabici, Persici, Turcici, et

                guides Ambrose Theseus and Francis Rivoli, he was
                obliged to have the Armenian types cast at his own expence. He corresponded with many learned contemporaries, as Longuerue, Spanheim, and Leibnitz, who, however, did not approve his notion of the Armenian being the

                1641, published in Spanish, by permission of the king,
                “<q>Nuevo Descubrimiento del gran rio de las Amazones,</q>”
                4to; but the projects expected from his discoveries respecting this river, were discountenanced afterwards by
                the house of Braganza, and Philip <sc>IV</sc>. ordered all the
                copies of this curious work to be destroyed, so that for
                many years two only were known to exist; one in the
                Vatican library, and another in the possession of Marin
                Leroi de Gomberville, who translated it into French, and
                published it, under the title of “<q date="1682">Relation de la riviere des
                    Amazones,</q>” Paris, <date event="work">1682</date>, 2 vols. 12mo, with a curious
                dissertation; but some passages of the text are not very
                faithfully translated. This was afterwards reprinted in
                the second volume of Wood’s Rogers’ s Voyage round the
                world. Acuna went to the East Indies some time after
                the publication of his work, and is supposed to have died
                at Lima about or soon after 1675.</p>

                born at Vendome in 1663, and after finishing his studies,
                entered into the service of the prince of Conti, who appointed him to be his secretary. He was elected into
                the French academy in 1723, in room of the abbe Fleury.
                He translated part of De Thou’s history, which has London on the title, but was printed at Paris, 1734, 16 vols,
                4to. This he undertook with Charles Le Beau, the abbes
                Mascrier, Le Due, Fontaines, Prevost, and father Fabre.
                He translated also the memoirs of Montecuculli, Amsterdam, 1734, 12mo; an account of the cardinal Tournon;
                Atheneus; and other works. He died Nov. 12, 1735.</p>

            <p>, brother of the preceding, and likewise an eminent artist, was born at Nancy,
                March 22, 1705. He studied under his father at Paris, and
                in 1726 went to Rome. Two years after he gained one of
                the prizes of the academy of St. Luke. At this time his
                brother, the subject of the preceding article, and Francis,
                a younger brother, were at Rome, and assisted each other
                in their labours. After a residence of nine years, he returned to Paris, and with some opposition was admitted
                into the academy, where he exhibited his model of “<q>Prometheus,</q>” but did not execute it until long after. Next
                year he executed the “<q>martyrdom of St. Victoria,</q>” a bas-relief in bronze, for the royal chapel at Versailles. For
                some time he assisted his brother in “<q>the Neptune;</q>” but,
                a disagreement occurring, quitted this, and employed
                himself at the hotel Soubise, the chamber of accounts, and
                the abbey of St. Dennis. He was a candidate for the
                mausoleum of the cardinal de Fleury, and the public adjudged him the prize; but Lemoyne was employed. The
                tomb of the queen of Poland, wife of Stanislaus, is esteemed
                one of his best works. His Prometheus was finished in
                1763, and the king of Prussia offered him 30,000 franks
                for it; but Adam said it was executed for his master, and
                no longer his own property. He died March 27, 1778, in
                his 75th year. His merits as a sculptor have been thought
                equal to those of his brother. It is said to have been his
                constant prayer that he might be neither the first northe
                last in his art, but attain an honourable middle rank, as
                the surest way to avoid jealousy on the one hand, or contempt on the other; and his last biographer thinks his
                prayer was heard. The younger brother, <csc>Francis</csc>-<csc>Gaspard</csc>,
                exercised his profession as a sculptor for some years with
                considerable reputation, and obtained a prize from the
                French academy, but no important works of his are mentioned; he died at Paris in 1759.</p>

                professor of rhetoric in the college of Lisieux. The duke
                de Choiseul, who had a friendship for him, sent him to Venice as charge d'affaires to that republic, where he resided
                twelve years. On his return to France, he published his
                various elementary treatises, which have been much approved by teachers. 1. “<q date="1787">La vraie maniere d'apprendre
                    une Langue quelconque, vivante ou morte, par le moyen de

                <date event="work">1780</date>. Besides these, he published literal translations of
                Horace, 1787, 2 vols. 8vo. Phoedrus, and Dr. Johnson’s
                Rassclas. He died in Paris, 1792, leaving behind him the

                Jan. 23; and doctor of divinity, July 3, 1685. He was

                and elected rector of Lincoln College, May 2, 1685. The

                Durham, was removed to the tenth in 1695, and from

                vice-chancellor in 1695, and died June 17, 1719. As rector of Lincoln, he held the living of Twiford; and having
                received £.1500 for renewing the lease, he laid out the
                whole in beautifying the chapel of his college, and the
                rector’s lodgings. He bequeathed his library also to the

            <p>, an Italian poet, a descendant
                from the ancient family of Adimari, at Florence; was
                born in 1579. Between 1637 and 1640 he published six
                collections of fifty sonnets each, under the names of six
                of the muses: Terpsichore, Clio, Melpomene, Calliope,
                Urania, and Polyhymnia, which partake of the bad taste of
                his age, in forced sentiments and imagery; but he was an
                accomplished scholar in the Greek and Latin languages.
                His translation of Pindar, “<q date="1631">Ode di Pindaro, tradotte da

                he appears indebted to the Latin translation of Erasmus
                Schmidt. Of his private history we only know that he
                lived poor and unhappy, and died in 1649.</p>

                and educated at the university of Pisa, where the celebrated Luca Terenzi was his tutor. He visited, when
                young, the different courts of Italy, and was beloved for
                his talents and accomplishments. He received from the
                duke Ferdinand Charles of Mantua, the title of marquis,
                and gentleman of his chamber. He was also member of
                the academy of Florence, of De la Crnsca, and many other
                learned societies. He succeeded the famous Redi as professor of the Tuscan language in the academy of Florence,
                and was likewise professor of chivalry in that of the nobles,
                in which science his lectures, which he illustrated with
                apposite passages from ancient and modern history, were
                highly esteemed. These were never printed, but manuscript copies are preserved in several of the libraries of
                Florence. His only prose work, a collection of religious
                pieces, was published at Florence, 1706, small 4to, under
                the title “<q>Prose sacre.</q>” His poetry consists of: 1. “<q>Sonnets and other lyric pieces,</q>” and among them, a collection of Odes or Canzoni, dedicated to Louis <sc>XIV</sc>, and
                magnificently printed at Florence, 1693. 2. Some “<q>Dramas,</q>” one of which “<q date="1679">Le Gare dell' Amore etdelP Amicitia,</q>”
                Florence, <date event="work">1679</date>, 12mo, is so rare as to be unnoticed by
                any historian of Italian literature. 3. “<q>Five Satires,</q>” on
                which his fame chiefly rests; very prolix, but written in
                an elegant style; and as to satire, just and temperate,
                except where he treats of the fair sex. He died at Florence, after a tedious illness, June 22, 1708.</p>

                time in the monastery of Pruni, but meeting with some
                unpleasant circumstances there, he went to Rome, where
                he spent five years in amassing materials for the works
                which he afterwards wrote. On his return he was employed by Remi, archbishop of Lyons, in his diocese, and
                was elected archbishop of Vienne in the year 860. His
                vigilance over his clergy, his care in the instruction of his
                flock, his frequent visitations throughout his province, and
                the humility and purity of his private life, distinguished
                him in an age not remarkable for these virtues. He appears to have been consulted also in affairs of state, when,
                he gave his opinion, and urged his remonstrances with
                firmness and independence. He died Dec. 16, 875. He
                is the author of, 1. “<q>An Universal Chronicle,</q>” from the
                creation of the world, which has been often cited as authority for the early history of France. It was printed at
                Paris, 1512, 1522, fol. 156], 8vo; and at Rome, 1745,
                fol. 2. “<q>A Martyrology,</q>” better arranged than any preceding, and enriched by the lives of the saints. It was
                printed by Rosweide, Antwerp, 1613; and Paris, 1645,
                fol.; and is inserted in the Bibliotheque des Peres. He
                also wrote the life of St. Didier, which is in Canisius; and

                in 1521, in consequence of a fall from his horse. In 1518,
                he published a Latin translation of Dioscorides “<q>De Materia Medica,</q>” with a commentary. About the end of it
                he mentions a treatise, “<q>De mensuris, ponderibus, et coloribus,</q>” which he had prepared for publication, but which

                Florence in 1579. In his youth, he carried arms in defence of the liberties of his country, and afterwards devoted his time to study. For thirty years he taught rhetoric
                in the university of Florence, and enjoyed the friendship
                of the most celebrated of his contemporaries, Annibal
                Caro, Varchi, Flaminio, and the cardinals Bembo and
                Contarini. His chief work, which forms a continuation
                of Guicciardini, is the history of his own time, entitled
                “<q date="1536">Deir Istoria de' suoi tempi,</q>” from <date event="work">1536</date> to 1574. Florence, 1583, fol. This is a most scarce edition, and more
                valued than that of Venice, 1587, 3 vols. 4to. The abbé
                Lenglet du Fresnoy, Bayle, and particularly Thuanus,
                who has derived much assistance from this work, speak
                highly of his correctness as a historian. He had the best
                materials, and among others, some memoirs furnished by
                the grand duke of Tuscany, Cosmo I. who advised him to
                the undertaking. He is said to have written funeral orations
                on the grand duke, on Charles V. and the emperor Ferdinand; but we know only of his oration on the grand
                duchess, Jane of Austria, which was translated from Latin
                into Italian, and published at Florence in 1579, 4to. In
                1567 he published “<q>Lettera a Giorgio Vasari sopra gli
                    antichi Pittori nominati da Plinio,</q>” 4to. This letter, oa
                the ancient painters mentioned by Pliny, which is rather
                a treatise on painting, is inserted by Vasari in the second
                volume of his lives of the painters. Vasari speaks of him
                as an enlightened amateur of the fine arts, and one whose
                advice was of much importance to him when he was employed at Florence in the palace of the grand duke.</p>

            <p>, sonof the preceding, born in 1533,
                was so distinguished for his studies, as to obtain, when
                very young, the professorship of rhetoric which his father
                held in the university of Florence. So our authority; but
                there seems to be some mistake in this date, as he could
                not be very young when he succeeded his father as professor of rhetoric, if his father filled that chair for the space
                of thirty years. He was, however, a member of the academy of Florence, and published his father’s history. His
                own works are, 1. An Italian translation of “<q>Demetrius
                    Phalereus</q>” on eloquence, which he left in manuscript,
                and which was not published until 1738, by Antony Francis
                Gori, who prefixed a long account of the life and writings
                of the translator; 2. Two Lectures on the “<q>Education of
                    the Florentine Nobility,</q>” printed in the “<q>Prose Fiorentine,</q>” vol. <sc>IV</sc>. He also translated Plutarch’s Morals, not
                yet published, but much commended by Ammirato and
                others. There are two copies in the Laurentian library;

            <p>, a geographer of considerable note, was born at Delft in Holland, February 14,
                1533, After applying to his studies with much assiduity,
                he was ordained priest in 1561, and was director of the
                nuns of St. Barbara until the civil wars obliged him to take
                refuge first at Mecklin, then at Maestricht, and lastly at
                Cologne, where he died, June 20, 1585. He published
                “<q date="1578">Vita Jesu Christi, ex quatuor evangelistis breviter contexta,</q>” Antwerp, <date event="work">1578</date>, 12mo; but the work for which
                he is best known is his “<q>Theatrum Terra; Sanctse,</q>” or,
                history of the Holy Land, illustrated with maps, and printed
                in 1590, 1595, 1600, 1628, and 1682, foL; a proof of the
                esteem in which it was long held, although his authorities
                are thought to be sometimes exceptionable. The second
                part, which contains a description of Jerusalem, was printed
                by the author in 1584, and was reprinted after his death
                in 1588, and 1592, 8vo. He sometimes took the name

            <p>, a lawyer, was born at
                Antwerp in 1486. He was educated under the care of the
                celebrated Erasmus, with whom he lived afterwards in close
                friendship, as he did with the illustrious sir Thomas More,
                and other eminent scholars of that age. More introduces
                him in the prologue to his Utopi with high praise, as “<q>a
                    man there in his country of honest reputation, and also preferred to high promotions, worthy truly of the highest.
                    For it is hard to say whether the young man be in learning
                    or in honesty more excellent. For he is both of wonderful virtuous conditions, and also singularly well learned,
                    and towards all sorts of people exceeding gentle.</q>” Sir
                Thomas adds, that “<q>the charms of his conversation abated
                    the fervent desire he had to see his native country, from
                    which sir Thomas had been absent more than four months.</q>”
                He occurs also with high praise in the life and writings of
                Erasmus. In 1510, on the death of Adrian Blict, first notary at Antwerp, he was unanimously elected into his place.
                He died Nov. 29, 1533. His works are, 1. “<q date="1519">Threnodiain
                    funus Maximiliani Caesaris, cum Epitaphiis aliquot et Epigrammatum libello,</q>” Antwerp, <date event="work">1519</date>, 4to. 2. “<q>Hypotheses, sive Spectacula Carolo V. Caesari ab S. P. Q. Antver.</q>”

            <p>, a Dutch painter,
                born at Delft in 1602, acquired a great reputation by his
                delicate manner of painting fruit, still life, and dead game.
                He was exact in copying every thing after nature, disposing them with elegance, and finishing his pictures with
                neatness, and transparency of colour. Whether he painted dead game, fruit, helmets with plumes of feathers, or
                vases of gold and silver, to each he gave a true and striking
                resemblance of nature, and an extraordinary lustre to the
                gold, silver, and steel. He died in 1658.</p>

                1620, and arrived at a much higher degree of perfection
                than his instructor. In his youth he went to France, and
                exercised his art there for four years, and afterwards to
                Rome, where he resided for seven years; and in both places
                was encouraged by the patronage of persons of the first
                distinction. In 1656, he returned to his own country,
                and settled at Amsterdam, where his pictures were highly
                valued, and sold at a very great price. Some of them are
                still in the collections of the amateurs of that city. Van
                Aelst knew his own merit, and would not submit to disrespect. On one occasion when a burgomaster of Amsterdam gave him a very haughty answer in a matter of some
                importance to him, he opened his breast and shewed him
                a gold chain and medal which the grand duke of Tuscany
                had given him, adding, “<q>You came into the world with a
                    sack of money, that is all your merit as to mine, it is in
                    my talents.</q>” Like his uncle he employed himself chiefly
                on still life, and his pencil was so light, and his touch so
                delicate, that the objects he painted seemed real. He died
                in 1679.</p>

            <p>, a nobleman, born at Venice
                in 1481, carried arms in his youth, and was taken prisoner.
                On his release he made a vow to dedicate his life to the
                care of orphans, and accordingly collected a considerable
                number of them in a house, where they were educated in
                virtue and industry. This laid the foundation of the regular clerks of St. Maieul, who are also called the fathers of
                Somasquo, from the place where he first established their
                community. They were afterwards successively confirmed by the popes Paul <sc>III</sc>. and Pius <sc>IV</sc>. Their chief occupation was to instruct young persons in the principles of
                the Christian religion, and particularly orphans. He appears to have been a man of a most humane disposition;
                and in 1528, when plague and famine raged in Italy, he
                sold even his furniture to assist the poor. He died in 1537,
                and was admitted into the number of saints by Benedict

                the Protestant religion. He studied first at Aix-la-Chapelle, and afterwards at Juliers under Kunius, and at Dort
                under Adrian Marcellus, and Gerard Vossius. At Leyden,
                he attended the lectures of Baudius, and spent four years
                in visiting the foreign universities. On his return, in
                1615, he succeeded Vossius as rector of the college at
                Dort. At Utrecht he was, some years after, appointed
                professor of history; the subjects of the lectures which he
                gave for above twenty-six years, were taken from Tacitus.
                He was a firm supporter of the Cartesian philosophy, and
                refused to have any hand in the proceedings of the university of Utrecht against Des Cartes. He died Nov. 10, 1660.

                1802. He is best known to the learned world by his
                “<q>Tentamen theoriae Electricitatis et Magnetismi,</q>” Petersburgh, 4to; of which M. Haiiy published an abridgement and analysis, Paris, 1787, 8vo. In 1762 he also published “<q>Reflections on the distribution of Heat on the sur-&lt;
                    face of the Earth,</q>” translated afterwards into French by
                Raoult de Rouen, and wrote several papers in the memoirs
                of the academy of Petersburgh. He was likewise among
                the first who made correct experiments on the electricity of
                the tourmalin, and published the result in a small volume,
                8vo, Petersburgh, 1762. His reputation has been much
                greater on the continent, than among the philosophers of
                our country; probably owing to the very slight and almost
                unintelligible account which Dr. Priestley has given of his
                “<q>Tentamen,</q>” in his history of Electricity. The hon. Mr.

                Transactions, vol. <sc>LXI</sc>, where his own excellent dissertation
                is an extensive and accurate explanation of JEpinus’s theory.

            <p>, a fellow-labourer with Luther in promoting the Reformation, was born 1499, in the Marche of
                Brandenburgh. His family name was Huch, or Hsech,
                which he changed to Æpinus, a custom very common with
                the learned men of his time. He was originally a Franciscan friar, and entered that society when in England; but
                on his return to Germany he studied under Luther, whose
                religious principles he adopted, and propagated with zeal,
                first at Stralsund, and afterwards at Hamburgh, where, as
                pastor of the church of St. Peter, and ecclesiastical inspector, he obtained great influence. In 1547, when
                Charles V. endeavoured to obtrude the Interim on the Protestants, after he had defeated their forces, and after the
                death of Luther, he opposed this species of formulary, or
                confession of faith, so called because it was only to take
                place in the interim, until a general council should decide
                all the points in question between the Protestants and Catholics. It indeed satisfied neither party, and the Lutheran
                preachers refused to subscribe to it. Those who did subscribe got the name of adiaphorists, or indifferent or lukewarm persons, against whom Æpinus contended, both in
                the pulpit and press. He died May 13, 1553, leaving several works, of which Melchior Adam has given the subjects, but no notice of the dates, or proper titles. In
                learning, zeal, and intrepid spirit, he was equal to most of
                his contemporaries who opposed the church of Rome.</p>

            <p>, called by the Italians PietroLongo,
                from his tallness, was a celebrated painter, and born at Amsterdam in 1519. His father, who was a stocking-maker,
                had intended to train him in his own way; but-the mother,
                finding in him an inclination towards painting, was resolved
                that her son should pursue his genius, even though she always were forced to spin for her livelihood: and to this her
                husband at length consented. His first master was Alart
                Claessen, an eminent painter in Amsterdam, under whom
                he so distinguished himself, that he soon engaged the attention of the great. When he was about eighteen, he
                went to Bossu in Hainault, to view the pieces of several
                masters; thence to Antwerp, where he married and entered
                into the company of painters. He excelled very particularly in representing a kitchen; and generally, upon all
                kinds of subjects. An altar-piece of his, viz. a crucifix,
                setting forth an executioner breaking with an iron bar the
                legs of the thieves, &amp;c. was much admired. This noble
                piece was destroyed by the rabble in the time of the insurrection, 1566, although the lady of Sonneveldt, in Alckmaer, offered 200 crowns for its redemption, as the furious
                peasants were bringing it out of the church: but they tore
                it to pieces, and trod it under foot. This he afterwards
                complained of to the populace in terms of such severity,
                that more than once they were going to murder him. Pilkington, however, speaks of a fine altar-piece of bis at Amsterdam, representing the death of the Virgin, as still
                existing; and of a Nativity and the Wise Men’s Offering at Delft,
                both excellent performances. He was well skilled in perspective and architecture, and enriched his grounds with
                elegant ornaments and animals. His figures were well disposed; their attitudes had abundance of variety, and their
                draperies were well chosen and well cast. He died in 1585,
                leaving three sons, who succeeded in his profession. He
                had a mean aspect, which he did not amend by any attention to the exterior; for he always appeared very meanly
                dressed.</p>

        <body>
            <p>,
                an eminent lawyer, the grandson of Matthew Afflitto, counsellor-royal in 1409 under Ladislaus, was born at Naples
                about 1430. Being attached to the study of law from his
                youth, he made great progress, and acquired so much reputation, that he was promoted to the council of state by
                king Ferdinand I. and shared the confidence of that
                prince and of his son, afterwards Alphonsus <sc>II</sc>. He was
                afterwards appointed president of the royal chamber, and
                was employed in public transactions of the greatest importance under five successive kings of Naples. To the knowledge displayed in his works, he joined the strictest
                probity and most amiable manners. Camerario, lieutenant
                of the royal chamber, and an eminent feudal lawyer, gives
                him the character of the most learned and excellent man
                of his own or the preceding age; nor are Ferron and Fontanella more sparing of their praises. Pancirollus only
                considers him as rather laborious than acute in his writings.
                Notwithstanding the distractions of the times in which he
                lived, and his numerous labours, he reached the age of
                eighty, and died in 1510. He was interred in the conventual church of Monte-Vergine in Naples, under a
                monument representing St. Eustachius, from whom his
                family derived their origin. He was twice married, and
                from his second wife, Diana Carmignana, are descended
                the Afflittos, barons of Rocca-Gloriosa.

            <p>, an Italian
                lady of great learning, was born at Milan, March 16, 1718.
                Her inclinations from her earliest youth led her to the
                study of science, and at an age when young persons of her
                sex attend only to frivolous pursuits, she had made such
                astonishing progress in mathematics, that when in 1750
                her father, professor in the university at Bologna, was unable to continue his lectures from infirm health, she obtained permission from the pope, Benedict <sc>XIV</sc>. to fill his
                chair. Before this, at the early age of nineteen, she had
                supported one hundred and ninety-one theses, which were
                published, in 1738, under the title “<q>Propositiones Philosophicse.</q>” She was also mistress of Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
                French, German, and Spanish. At length she gave up her
                studies, and went into the monastery of the Blue Nuns, at
                Milan, where she died Jan. 9, 1799. In 1740 she published a discourse tending to prove “<q>that the study of the
                    liberal arts is not incompatible with the understandings of
                    women,</q>” This she had written when scarcely nine years
                old. Her “<q date="1748">Instituzioni analitiche,</q>” <date event="work">1748</date>, 2 vols. 4to,
                were translated in part by Antelmy, with the notes of M.
                Bossut, under the title of “<q date="1775">Traites elementaires du Calcul
                    differentiel et du Calcul integral,</q>” <date event="work">1775</date>, 8vo: but more
                completely into English by that eminent judge of mathematical learning, the late rev. John Colson, M. A. F. R. S.
                and Lucasian professor of mathematics in the university of Cambridge. This learned and ingenious man, who
                had translated sir Isaac Newton’s Fluxions&gt; with a comment, in 1736, and was well acquainted with what appeared on the same subject, in the course of fourteen years
                afterward, in the writings of Emerson, Maclaurin, and
                Simpson, found, after all, the analytical institutions of Agnesi to be so excellent, that he learned the Italian language,
                at an advanced age, for the sole purpose of translating that
                work into English, and at his death left the manuscript
                nearly prepared for the press. In this state it remained for
                some years, until Mr. Baron Ma&amp;eres, with his usual liberal and active spirit, resolved to defray the whole expence
                of printing a handsome edition, 2 vols. 4to, 1801, which
                was superintended in the press by the rev. John Hellins,
                B. D. F. R. S. vicar of Potter’s-pury, in Northamptonshire.
                Her eloge was pronounced by Frisi, and translated into
                French by Boulard.</p>

            <p>, a sculptor and architect of Florence, was born in 1460, and was first distinguished for
                the beauty of his inlaid work, which he applied to articles
                of furniture, and with which he ornamented the stalls in
                the choir of the church of St. Maria-Novelle. He also
                executed the carved wooden work on the organ of the
                same church, and on the altar of de la Nunziata. Having
                been led to the study of architecture, he came to Rome to
                devote his attention to it, but did not give up the practice
                of carving, and soon had a favourable opportunity to exercise both. When Leo X. travelled in Italy, all the cities
                through which he passed wished to receive him with honour, and Baccio gave designs for many of the triumphal
                arches ordered to be erected. On his return to his country, his workshop became a sort of academy to which amateurs, artists, and strangers resorted. Raphael, then very
                young, and Michael Angelo are said to have been of these
                parties. By this means Baccio acquired great reputation,
                and was employed on many splendid buildings in Florence.
                Conjointly with Cronaca, he executed the decorations of
                the grand saloon of the palace, and the beautiful staircase
                leading to it. But his best work is to be seen in the Bartolini palace and garden. Here he shewed the first specimen of square windows surmounted by pediments, and
                doors ornamented by columns, a mode which although followed generally since, was much ridiculed by his countrymen as an innovation. In other palaces he executed some
                beautiful ornaments in wood. He preserved his vigour
                and reputation to a great age, dying in 1543, in his eightythird year. He left three sons, one of whom, Giuliano, inherited his skill in architecture, but designed more than
                he executed.</p>

            <p>, of Valerano, an eminent musician,
                was born in 1593, and was the scholar of Bernardo Nanini,
                and successor to Soriano in the pontifical chapel. Antinio
                Liberati speaks of him as one of the most scientific and
                ingenious composers of his time, in every species of music
                then cultivated; and adds, that when he was master of the
                chapel of St. Peter’s church at Rome, he astonished the
                musical world with his productions for four, six, and eight
                choirs or choruses; some of which might be sung in four
                or six parts only, without diminishing or enervating the
                harmony. Father Martini, who bears testimony to the
                truth of this eulogium, has inserted an Agnus Dei, in eight
                parts, of this composer, which is truly a curious production, three different canons being carried on at the same
                time, in so clear and natural a manner, both as to melody
                and harmony, that this learned father, who had been long
                exercised in such arduous enterprizes, speaks of it as one
                of the greatest efforts of genius and learning in this most difficult kind of composition. Agostino died in 1629, in the
                prime of life.</p>

            <p>, a singular impostor and enthusiast, the daughter of Francis Coronel, was born at Agreda
                in 1602. Her father made his house a convent of female
                Cordeliers, under the name of The Immaculate Conception,
                and his wife and daughters made profession. Maria was
                elected superior of the convent, and died there in 1665,
                after having written “<q>The Mystical City of God,</q>” which
                contains a life of the blessed Virgin, full of absurdity and
                impiety. Yet it was printed at Lisbon, at Madrid, at Perpignan, and at Antwerp, and at last translated into French
                by father Crozet, and printed at Brussels, 3 vols. 4to, and
                8 vols. 8vo. The doctors of the Sorbonne condemned it;
                but their sentence was not allowed to be promulgated in
                Spain, where this work was highly popular.</p>

            <p>, a German physician, eminent
                for his knowledge of metallurgy, was born at Glaucha in
                Misnia, March 24, 1494. The discoveries which he made
                in the mountains of Bohemia after his return from Italy,
                whither he went to pursue his studies, gave him such a taste
                for examining every thing that related to metals, that when
                engaged in the practice of physic at Joachimstal in Misnia,
                he employed all the time he could possibly spare in the
                study of fossils; and at length removed to Chemintz, that
                he might wholly devote himself to this pursuit. He is said
                to have applied to it with such disinterested zeal, that he
                riotonly spent the pension procured for him from Maurice,
                duke of Saxony, but a considerable part of his own estate;
                and when duke Maurice and duke Augustus went to join
                the army of Charles V. in Bohemia, Agricola attended them,
                in order to demonstrate his attachment, although this
                obliged him to quit the care of his family and estate. He
                died at Chemiutz, Nov. 21, 1555. He was a zealous Roman Catholic, but was considered by the Lutherans as in
                some respects an apostate from the reformed, religion, and
                they carried their rancour against him so far as to refuse his
                body the rites of burial. It was therefore obliged to be removed from Chemintz to Zeits, where it was interred in
                the principal church. Bayle thinks that he must have irritated the Lutherans by some instances of excessive aversion
                to them, and Peter Albinus represents him as an intolerant
                bigot. His works are “<q>De ortu et causis Subterraneorum. De natura eorum, quae effluunt ex terra. De
                    natura Fossilium. De Medicatis Fontibus. De Subterraneis Animantibus. De veteribus et novis Metallis. De
                    re Metallica.</q>” This last has been printed at Basil
                four times, in folio, 1546, 1556, 1558, and 1561, which
                shews the very high esteem in which it was held. His work
                “<q date="1583">De ortu et causis Subterraneorum</q>” was printed at Basil,
                <date event="work">1583</date>, fol. Bayle mentions a political work of his, “<q date="1538">De
                    bello Turcis inferendo,</q>” Basil, <date event="work">1538</date>, and a controversial
                treatise, “<q>De Traditionibus Apostolicis.</q>” His principal
                medical work, “<q date="1554">De Peste,</q>” was printed at Basil, <date event="work">1554</date>.
                He wrote also “<q>De Ponderibus et Mensuris</q>” against Budeus, Leonard Portius, and Alciati, which the latter endeavoured to answer, but without success. His life is written

                advantage of being educated under tfee care of Philip Sega,
                his uncle, who was raised on account of his distinguished
                merits to the rank of cardinal, by pope Innocent <sc>IX</sc>; and of
                Jerom Agucchio, his brother, who was made cardinal by
                pope Clement <sc>VIII</sc>. in 1604. His application to study
                mis early, rapid, and assiduous, but particularly in. the
                study of polite literature. This recommended him so
                much to cardinal Sega, that he carried him with him t0
                France, when he went thither as legate from the pope.</p>
            <p>After the death of Sega, Agucchio was appointed secretary to cardinal Aldobrandini, nephew to pope Clement

                of France, of which journey he wrote a very elegant account. The cardinal, after his return, committed the
                management of his house to Agucchio, which province he
                executed till the death of pope Clement <sc>VIII</sc>. and of his
                brother the cardinal Agucchio, when want of health
                obliged him to retire from the court. But after he had
                recovered, and had passed some time at Rome in learned
                retirement, cardinal Aldobrandini brought him again into
                his former employment, in which he continued till the
                cardinal’s death. He then became secretary to Gregory
                <sc>XV</sc>. which place he held until the death of that pontiff.
                In 1624, Urban <sc>VIII</sc>. sent him as nuncio to Venice,
                -where he became generally esteemed, although he maintained the rights of the see of Rome with the utmost rigour. The contagious distemper which ravaged Italy in
                1630, obliged him to retire to Friuli, where he died in
                1632. He was a man of very extensive learning, but appears in his private character to have been somewhat
                austere and narrow. His works are: “<q>A treatise upon
                    Comets and Meteors,</q>” “<q>The Life of Cardinal Sega, and
                    that of Jerom Agucchio his brother,</q>” and a letter to the
                canon Barthelemi Dolcini on the origin of the city of Bologna, “<q date="1638">L'Antica fondazione e dominio della citta di
                    Bologna,</q>” Bologna, <date event="work">1638</date>, 4to. He left also various letters and moral treatises, not published.</p>

            <p>, a very learned man of the
                17th century, was born at Logrogno, a city of Spain,
                March 24, 1630, and took the degree of D. D. in the university of Salamanca in 1668, and read lectures in that
                faculty for many years. He was censor and secretary of
                the supreme council of the inquisition in Spain, chief interpreter of the scriptures in the university of Salamanca,
                and had been more than once abbot of the college of St.
                Vincent, when he was honoured with a cardinal’s hat by
                Innocent <sc>XI</sc>. in 1686. He died at Rome Aug. 19, 1699.
                His life was very exemplary; and the dignity to which he
                was raised was so far from making any change in him, that
                he shewed an instance very uncommon, by retracting in
                an express piece the doctrine of probability, which he had
                before maintained, as soon as he found it was inconsistent
                with the purity of the Christian morality. His first work
                was entitled “<q date="1668">Ludi Salmanticenses sive Theologia Florulenta,</q>” printed in <date event="work">1668</date>, fol. These are dissertations
                which he wrote, according to the custom of the university
                of Salamanca, before he received his degree of D. D. there;
                an-d there are some things in them to which he objected in
                his more mature years. In 1671 he published three volumes in folio upon philosophy, and in 1673 “<q date="1677">A commentary upon Aristotle’s ten books of Ethics.</q>” In <date event="work">1677</date>
                he published “<q>A treatise upon Virtues and Vices, or Disputations on Aristotle’s Moral Philosophy.</q>” He then appfied himself to the study of St. Anselm’s works, upon
                whose principles in divinity he published “<q>The Theology
                    of St. Anselm,</q>” 3 vols. fol. 1690. In 1683 he published
                a large work against the declaration of the assembly of the
                French clergy made in 1682, concerning the ecclesiastical
                and civil power, under the title of “<q>A defence of the see
                    of St. Peter.</q>” The work for which he is chiefly celebrated
                is his “<q>Collection of the Councils of Spain</q>” with an introductory history. This was published in 1693-4, in 4 vols.
                fol.; and in 1753 in 6 vols. fol. He published a Prodromus of this work in 1686, 8vo. It is variously spoken of;
                Du Pin is inclined to depreciate its merit. Abstracts from
                it may be seen in the Acta Eruditorum of Leipsic, far the
                month of February, 1688, and some farther particulars in
                the General Dictionary.</p>

                writer, the son of Anthony Agylæus, originally of an
                Italian family, was born at Bois-le-duc, about 1533, where
                he was educated, and became a distinguished Greek
                scholar. lu his youth he carried arms against the king of
                Spain, was appointed a deputy to the States Genera], a
                member of the supreme council, and advocate fiscal. But
                he is less known by his share in the defence of his country,
                than by his learning and writings. He published: 1. “<q date="1560">Novellae Justiniani Imp. Constitutiones,</q>” with Holoander’s

            <p>, professor of logic and metaphysics at GreifewaJd, was born in that town, Feb. 19, 1710,
                and died there, March 1, 1791, after having enjoyed considerable fame, from his learning, zeal, benevolence, and
                love of truth. His father was a poor shoe-maker, but by
                extreme ceconomy his son was enabled to pursue his studies at Greifswald, and afterwards at the university of Jena.
                He became the founder of the society or order of the Abelites, the object of which was the promotion of candour
                and sincerity. His favourite maxim was, “<q>Give every
                    thing on which you are immediately engaged, be it ever
                    so trifling, all the attention of which you are capable.</q>”
                He thought he had discovered that want of attention is
                the source of lukewarmness in the cause of virtue, and the
                great promoter of vice; and imputed his attachment to the
                duties of his office and of religion, to his constant observance of the above rule. His principal works are:
                1. “<q>Brontotheologie,</q>” or pious meditations on the phenomena of thunder and lightning, Greifswald, 1745, 8vo;
                translated into Dutch 1747. 2. “<q date="1742">Reflexions on the Augsburgh Confession,</q>” eight parts in Z vols. <date event="work">1742</date> 50, 4to,
                which may be considered as a continuation of Reinbeck’s
                large work on the same subject. 3. Some “<q>Sermons</q>” and
                “<q date="1734">Philosophical Dissertations.</q>” In those which he published in <date event="work">1734</date> and 1740, on the immortality of the soul,
                and the freedom of God, he introduced some opinions,
                which on more mature consideration he thought inconsistent with the truth, and published a confutation of
                them.</p>

            <p>, <csc>Ethelred</csc>, <csc>Ælred</csc>, or <csc>Ealred</csc>, abbot
                of Revesby in Lincolnshire in the reigns of king Stephen
                and king Henry <sc>II</sc>. was born of nobie parents, in 1109,
                and educated in Scotland, together with Henry, son of
                David, king of Scots. Upon his return into England, he
                took the habit in the Cistertian monastery of Revesby,
                where his extraordinary piety and learning soon raised him
                to the dignity of abbot. Leland says he outshone his
                brethren as the sun eclipses the brightness of the inferior
                luminaries: and endeared himself no less to the great
                men of the kingdom than to the monks of his own house.
                His great love of retirement, and a life of contemplation
                and study, induced him to decline all offers of ecclesiastical preferment, and even to refuse a bishopric. He was
                particularly attached to St. Austin’s works, especially his
                “<q>Confessions;</q>” and was a strict imitator of St. Bernard
                in his writings, words, and actions. He left behind him
                several monuments of his learning; in the composition of
                which he was assisted by Walter Daniel, a monk of the
                same convent. This abbot died January 12, 1166, aged
                fifty-seven years, and was buried in the monastery of
                Revesby, under a tomb adorned with gold and silver; and,
                we are told, he was canonized on account of some miracles
                said to have been wrought by him after his death.
            </p>
            <p>Of his works, the following have been printed in the
                “<q date="1652">Collection of ten English Writers</q>” by Roger Twisden,

                which is extant in manuscript in the library of Gonvil and
                Caius college in Cambridge. The following were published
                by Richard Gibbons, a Jesuit, at Doway, in 1631, and
                afterwards in the “<q>Bibliotheca Cistertiensis,</q>” and in the
                “<q>Bibliotheca Patrum;</q>” namely, “<q>Sermones de Tempore

            <p>, provost of Queen’s college, Oxford,
                was born in Westmoreland in 1559, educated in grammatical learning under the care of Bernard Gilpin, usually called the Northern Apostle, and by him sent to St. Edmund’s
                hall, Oxford, in 1579. He was then 19 years of age, and
                was maintained at the university by Gilpin, who afterwards
                left him a handsome legacy by his last will. Mr. Airay
                soon removed from St. Edmund’s hall to Queen’s college,
                and in 1583, took his bachelor’s degree, was made tabarder,
                and in 1586 he commenced master of arts and was chosen
                fellow. About this time he went into orders, and became a
                constant preacher in the university, particularly in the
                church of St. Peter in the east. In 1594, he took the degree of B. D. and March 9, 1598-9, was elected provost of
                his college; and in 1606 he was appointed vice-chancellor.
                He wrote the following pieces: 1. “<q date="1618">Lectures upon the
                    whole Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians,</q>” London, <date event="work">1618</date>,
                4to. 2. “<q date="1621">The just and necessary Apology touching his
                    Suit in Law, for the Rector of Charlton on Otmore, in Oxfordshire,</q>” London, <date event="work">1621</date>, 8vo. 3. “<q>A Treatise against
                    bowing at the Name of Jesus.</q>” The lectures were preached
                in the church of St. Peter in the east, and were published
                by Christopher Potter, fellow, and afterwards provost of
                Queen’s college, with an epistle of his own composition
                prefixed to them. Airay ranks among the zealous Puritans,
                who were mostly Calvinists, and was a great supporter of
                his party in the university, where he was considered as a
                man of sincere piety, integrity, and learning. In 1602 when
                Dr. Howson, then vice-chancellor, wished to repress the
                practice of some Puritan divines of Oxford who preached
                against the ceremonies and discipline of the church, Dr.
                Airay and one or two otherlj were ordered to make submission by the queen’s commissioners who had investigated the
                matter; and this the others did, but Dr. Airay, according
                to Ant. Wood, appears to have been excused. In 1604,
                when king James, in commemoration of his escape from the
                Gowrie conspiracy, not only appointed an anniversary, but
                that there should always be a sermon and service on Tuesdays throughout the year, Dr. Airay introduced this last
                custom into Oxford, first at All Saints church, and then at
                St. Mary’s, with a rule that the sermons should be preached
                by the divines of the colleges in their respective turns. In
                1606, when vice-chancellor, he was one of the first to call
                Mr. Laud, afterwards the celebrated archbishop, to task for
                preaching sentiments which were supposed to favour popery.
                He died in Queen’s college, Oct. 10, 1616, aged fiftyseven, and was buried in the chapel. He bequeathed to
                the college some lands lying in Garsington, near Oxford.</p>

            <p>, a gentleman of Frizeland, was
                born at Doccum in 1600, of a considerable family. His
                father, Menard Aitzema, was burgomaster and secretary to
                the admiralty, and his uncle Foppius was resident for the
                states-general at Hamburgh, and often employed in negociations of the first importance. Leo had scarcely reached
                his sixteenth year, before he published his Poemuta Juvenilia, but was soon engaged in more serious studies, his
                uncle having procured him to be appointed counsellor of
                the Hanse towns, and their resident at the Hague. He is
                likewise said to have been twice in England on public affairs. The work for which he is best known is a compilation on the history of the United Provinces, written in
                Dutch, under the title of “<q>Zaken van Staat en Oorlog.</q>”
                Of this there have been two editions, the first in 16 vols.
                4to, 1657 1671, including the period between 1621 and
                1668. The second edition is in 7 vols. fol. 1669 1671,
                with an account of the peace of Munster, and a treatise entitled the “<q date="1650">Lion restored,</q>” or an account of Dutch affairs in <date event="work">1650</date> and 1651, which had been separately
                published in 1652, 4to. The first edition is most
                esteemed by collectors of history, as in the second there
                were several omissions, although not of great importance;
                on the other hand this second is more correct, and the articles better arranged. It consists of an immense collection of original acts, instructions, memorials, letters, correspondence of crowned heads, &amp;c. taken from the most
                authentic and often most secret sources. He is said to
                have employed much address in procuring the documents
                which he wanted. His connection with men in office gave
                him considerable advantages, but he often used means not
                quite so ingenuous and delicate. The Dutch reproach
                him with having divulged their secret correspondence with
                foreign courts, and particularly with England, and he is
                also accused of irreligious principles. Wicquefort, in his
                Ambassador, speaks slightingly of the original part of this
                great work, in which Bayle says he cannot agree with him.

                of sixteen, he passed rive years in the college of Luneburgh, and went from that to Wittemherg, where he distinguished himself by the able defence of his theses. In
                1595, he was called home, and made joint rector of the

            <p>, son of the preceding, was born at
                Krempen in 1600, and first studied there and at Harhburgh.
                At the age of nineteen, he went to the academy of Leipsic,
                where he entered on a course of theology and political
                science. In 1624, he had acquired much reputation both
                as a philosopher and a poet. When he returned to Krempen, he was made dean of the college, and held that station during five years. After this, the king of Denmark
                appointed hin&gt; inspector of the schools at Brunswick, and
                assessor of the council of Meldorf, In 1643, by order of

                able, on account of the war, to go into Saxony, he was

            <p>, a celebrated physician of
                Sicily, was born in 1590 at Ragalbuto, in the valley of
                Demona, and when young acquired great reputation for
                his proficiency in classical learning, and in the study of
                philosophy. He then made choice of the profession of
                medicine, and received his doctor’s degree at Messina in
                1610. In 1616 he settled at Palermo, where he practised
                with uncommon success, his advice being eagerly sought
                at home and abroad, by persons of all ranks who corresponded with him in cases where his visits could not be procured. His fame rose highest, however, in 1624, when
                he practised with so much skill, humanity, and success,
                during the rage of the plague in Palermo, and other parts
                of Sicily. While in this prosperous career, he was in vain
                solicited to accept a professor’s chair in the university of
                Bologna, and the office of first physician to the king of
                Naples. Nothing could seduce him from his connexions
                in Palermo, where he had the principal hand in founding
                the medical academy. He is celebrated also for his piety
                and munificence towards religious institutions. He died
                August 29, 1662. His principal works are in Latin.

                and displayed much learning while he held the place of
                librarian of the Vatican. He had great taste and knowledge of antiquities, and became a munificent patron of
                learning and learned men. His house, known by the name
                of the Villa Albani, was decorated with valuable statues
                and other treasures of the fine arts. He also found leisure
                from his political engagements to write some historical and
                literary works, which are held in much esteem. In 1762,

                masters, the others, collections of the most capital engravings, were sold to his present majesty of Great Britain,

                army, but preferred the study of the civil and canon law,
                in which, as well as in polite literature, he attained
                great eminence. At first, however, he bore arms in the
                Venetian army, and afterwards went into the church.
                Pope Pius V. was no sooner raised to that dignity, than
                he made Albani a cardinal, in 1570. It is even said that
                after the death of Gregory <sc>XIII</sc>. the conclave would have
                elected him pope, but he was then a widower and had

                and had in his youth the title of the chevalier d‘Albert. In
                1688, he served as a volunteer at the siege of Philipshurgh;
                in 1690 he was twice wounded in the battle of Fleurus; and
                in 1693, commanded the Dauphin regiment of dragoons at
                Steinkirk, where he was again wounded. In 1703, he accompanied marshal Villars into Bavaria, where the elector
                promoted him to the rank of lieutenant-general. He was
                then known by the title of count d’ Albert, and was successively chamberlain, master of the horse, minister, and
                colonel of the Bavarian guards. The elector having arrived

                appointed count d' Albert field marshal, and sent him to

            <p>, a painter of
                some distinction, but whose reputation is chiefly established
                by his engravings, was born in 1552 atBorgo S. Sepolcbro,
                from which he derived one of his names. From his father,
                Michele Alberti, he learned the first rudiments of historical painting, in which art he made very considerable progress. His greatest works are in fresco at Rome; and he
                also painted in oil, and combined some thought with much
                practice. From whose instructions he became an engraver
                is uncertain, but his best style of execution seems evidently
                to have been founded on the prints of C. Cort and Agostino Caracci, though in his friezes and other slighter plates
                he owed much to the works of Francesco Villemena. The
                engravings of Alberti are never very highly finished, or
                powerful in effect. The lights are scattered and left untinted, as well upon the distances, as upon the principal
                figures of the fore-ground, which destroys the harmony, and,
                prevents the proper gradation of the objects. The drawing
                of the naked parts of the figure, in the works of this artist,
                is rarely incorrect: the extremities are well marked, and
                the characters of the heads generally very expressive: but
                his draperies are apt to be rather stitf and hard. His prints
                may be considered as very extraordinary efforts of a great
                genius, whilst the art was as yet at some considerable distance from perfection. The number of plates, great and
                small, engraved by this artist, amounts to nearly one hundred and eighty, of which seventy-five are from his own
                compositions, the rest from Michael Angelo Buonaroti,
                Raphael, Polidoro, Andrea del Sarto, &amp;c. The “<q date="1615">Miracle
                    of St. Philip Benizzo</q>” is one of the most excellent. Alberti died in <date event="work">1615</date>.</p>

                notes, 1543, 4to; a work which procured him the title of
                chancellor of Austria, and chevalier of St. James. He
                published in 4to, in 1556, a New Testament in Syriac,
                from the manuscript used by the Jacobites, at the expence
                of the emperor Ferdinand I. It contains neither the second epistle of Peter, nor the second and third of John,
                nor that of Jude, nor the Apocalypse. Only 1000 copies
                were printed, of which five hundred remained in Germany,
                and the rest were sent to the Levant. It is impossible for
                any thing to be more elegant, or better proportioned, says
                pere Simon, than the characters of this edition. Some
                copies have the date of T562. He also composed a Syriac

            <p>, avery eminent German physician,
                and one of the ablest scholars, and supporters of the opinions
                of Stahl, was born at Nuremberg, Nov. 13, 1682. He became professor of medicine at Hall, and an author of great
                celebrity. The object of the principal part of his works is
                to oppose the system of the mechanicians, and to establish
                that of Stahl; and although he may not be completely successful in this, it is generally agreed that his works contributed to throw great light on the sound practice of physic.
                Haller has given a copious list of his works, as well as of
                the disputations he maintained. Those which have contributed most to his fame, are, 1. “<q>Introductio in universam medicinam,</q>” 3 vols. 4to, Hall, 1718, 1719, 1721. In
                this he maintains the power of nature in the cure of diseases, and the danger of interfering with her operations.

            <p>, the pupil of Jerome Fabricius at

                Vesalius, Eustachius, and others who founded the new
                school of anatomy, and himself made several important discoveries in the structure of the ear, the eye, &amp;c. His “<q date="1583">Historia plerarumque humani corporis partium membratim

            <p>, professor of divinity at Leipsic, was born in 1635, at Lehna in Silesia, and died at
                Leipsic in 1697. He wrote a great many controversial
                treatises against Puffendorf, Thomasius, the Cartesians,
                Cocceians, and the adversaries of the Augsburgh
                communion, especially Bossuet and count Leopold de Collonitsch,
                bishop of Wienerisch-Nenstadt. Alberti attacked also the
                orthodoxy of the pious Spener, the Fenelon of the Lutheran church, but who has been censured for his leaning
                too ranch to the pietists and mystics. Among his writings,
                which have been most favourably received and frequently
                reprinted, we may notice his “<q>Compendium Juris naturae, 11

                Adelung, who has given a list of his works, says that his

                he made profession for six years. He afterwards taught
                philosophy, and became a popular preacher, and his zeal
                and talents pointed him out as the proper person to succeed to the vacant bishopric of Torcello, which, however,
                was given to another. The republic of Venice employed
                him in many affairs of state, and even sent him as ambassa
                dor to Turkey. He died in the prime of life in 1475,
                when his reputation was such, that a medal was struck in
                honour of his memory. He left, according to Sansovino,
                several works in Latin, on the knowledge of God, the history of the Servites, and other theological subjects, and an
                explanation of some passages in Dante. Possevin, in his

                Jesuits at the age of sixteen. After having taught the
                languages for seven years, he studied divinity, which he
                afterwards taught, with philosophy, for twelve years, and
                was successively rector of the colleges of Avignon, Aries,
                Grenoble, and Lyons. He died at Aries, Octobers, 1659.

                at Lyons, gave a translation of it in 1649, in which he professed to have undertaken this labour as an answer to those
                who declaimed against performing and attending mass in
                parishes; and when Albi’s Anti-Theophile appeared,
                answered him in a work entitled “<q>Reponse Chretienne.</q>”

            <p>, an eminent physician, whose
                proper name was <csc>Weiss</csc>, was born at Dessau, in the province of Anhalt, in 1653, and was the son of a burgomaster
                of that town. He studied first at Bremen, and afterwards
                at Leyden. In 1676, after taking his doctor’s degree in
                medicine, he travelled in Flanders, France, and Lorraine,
                and returned, in 1681, to the possession of a professor’s
                chair at Francfort on the Oder. In his mode of teaching
                he discovered those talents and that penetration, of which
                he exhibited some proofs while a student, and soon rose to
                wealth and distinction. He was appointed physician to the
                successive electors of Brandenburgh, who bestowed many
                honours upon him, and among other marks of their favour,
                gave him a prebend of Magdeburgh, exempting him, at
                the same time, from the duties of the place; but this he resigned, as the possession of so rich a preferment, under
                such circumstances, might give offence to his brethren.
                For a long time the obligations which these princes conferred prevented Albinus from accepting the many offers
                made to him by the universities of Europe; but at length,
                in 1702, he went to Leyden, where he was professor until
                his death in 1721. Carrere, in his “<q>Bibl. de Medicine,</q>”
                gives a list of twenty-two medical works by Albinus, among
                which are, 1. “<q>De corpusculis in sanguine contends.</q>”
                2. “<q>De Tarantula mira.</q>” 3. “<q>De Sacro Freyenwalden-t
                    sium fonte,</q>” &amp;c. The illustrious Boerhaave pronounced
                his eloge, which was afterwards printed, and contains an

                in 1599, and carried on the business of a merchant. Devoting his leisure hours to literature, he wrote a work entitled “<q>Viridarium anagrammaticum,</q>” and five “<q>Novels,</q>”
                which procured him, it is said, much reputation, not from
                their merit, but from their originality. In each of these
                novels, the author has contrived to get rid of one or other
                of the vowels: a is not to be found in the first, nor e in the
                second, &amp;c. But this idle whim was not original, the same
                having been practised by Tryphiodorus, whom Addison so
                pleasantly ridicules as one of the lipogrammatists, or letterdroppers of antiquity. Moreri gives us the title of another
                work by this author, printed at Lisbon, 1664. “<q>Psalteriurn

            <p>, <csc>Alçazar</csc>, or <csc>Alcasar</csc>, (Louis D'), a Spanish Jesuit, was born at Seville in 1554, and entered
                among the Jesuits in 1569, against the will of his family,
                who were in possession of a large estate. After he had
                been a teacher of philosophy, he taught divinity at Cordova and at Seville, for abov e twenty years. M uch of his
                life was spent in endeavouring to explain the book of the
                Revelations, and his first volume on the subject, “<q>Vestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalypsi,</q>” is said to have been
                the result of twenty years’ study and investigation. This
                work was printed at Antwerp, fol. 1604 and 1619, and at
                Lyons, 1616, fol.; and is accounted one of the best commentaries which had been produced by any writer of the
                Romish church. It is said that Grotius was considerably
                indebted to it; but neither Grotius, nor any other writer
                has followed him in supposing that the prophecies of the
                Apocalypse have been accomplished to the twentieth chapter. Pursuing this investigation, however, his next work
                was a commentary on such parts of the Old Testament as
                have any connexion with the Apocalypse; this was published in 1631, Lyons, fol. under the title, “<q>In eas veteris
                    Testament! partes, quas respicit Apocalypsis, nempe Cantica Canticorum, Psahnos complures, multa Danielis aliorumque librorum capita, libri V.</q>” There is a supplement to the first, on weights and measures, and to the second, on bad physicians. He died at Seville, June 16,
                1613.</p>

                we have no account of his family, nor are we quite certain
                of his Christian name, some calling him Henry, and some
                Albert. It is said, that he went to Nuremberg, and studied
                under Albert Durer, as he copied his style. As a painter,
                he attained considerable fame: the principal part of his
                works are in the churches and convents of Germany. Des
                Piles mentions a “<q>Nativity</q>” by him, which he accounts
                worthy of the admiration of the curious. He is, however,
                chiefly known by his engravings; and as, like many of the
                ancient engravers, particularly of Germany, he applied
                himself chiefly to the engraving of small plates, he has been
                classed by French authors among those they call little masters, and in this class he claims the first rank. The mechanical part of his engraving is extremely neat, and executed entirely with the graver. The light parts upon his
                flesh he has often rendered very soft and clear, by the addition of small long dots, which he has judiciously interspersed. His drawing of the naked figure, which he seems
                very fond of introducing, is much correcter than is usually
                found among the old German masters; and much less of
                that stiff taste, so common to them, appears in his best
                works. But Florent le Comte’s observation is certainly
                very just, that his men figures are far more correct than
                his women. His heads are very expressive in general, and
                his other extremities well marked, but sometimes rather
                heavy. But as his prints are very numerous, amounting,
                according to abbe de Marolles, to no less than 350, they
                cannot be supposed to be all equal; it is, therefore, necessary to see many of his prints, before any adequate judgment can be formed. The first collection of them was
                formed by the burgomaster Six, but to this many additions
                were made by Mariette, to the amount of 390 pieces, comprising many duplicates with differences. This collection
                was sold in France, in 1805, for 660 francs. He died at
                Soest, in 1558, in very poor circumstances,</p>

            <p>, two brothers, natives of Malaga, whose history has not been separated by
                their biographers. They studied the belles lettres, antiquities, and civil law, with equal ardour and equal reputation.
                They both became ecclesiastics, and even in their persons
                there was a very close resemblance. Joseph obtained a
                prebend of Cordova, which he resigned in favour of Bernard, that he might enter among the Jesuits. He
                afterwards became rector of the college of Granada. While
                among the Jesuits, he published a work on the “<q date="1605">Exemption of the regular Orders,</q>” Seville, <date event="work">1605</date>, 4to; and another entitled “<q date="1615">De religiosa disciplina tuenda,</q>” ibid. 4to,
                <date event="work">1615</date>. Bernard, his brother, was appointed grand vicar by
                the archbishop of Seville, don Pedro de Castro, but obtained permission to reside at Cordova. He was one of the
                most learned and high esteemed of the Spanish literati of
                his time, and eminent for his knowledge of the Greek,
                Hebrew, and Oriental languages and antiquities. He has
                left two works, in Spanish: 1. “<q date="1606">Origen de la lengua Castellana,</q>” Rome, <date event="work">1606</date>, 4to; 1682, fol.; to which he acknowledges his brother Joseph contributed liberally. 2. “<q date="1614">Varias antiguedades de Espana Africa y otras provincias,</q>”
                Antwerp, <date event="work">1614</date>, 4to. He also wrote a letter to pope Urban
                <sc>VIII</sc>. on the relics of certain martyrs, Cordova, 1630, fol.,

            <p>, bishop of Carlisle in the reigns of Henry <sc>VIII</sc>. Edward <sc>VI</sc>. and queen
                Mary, was born at Burnham in Buckinghamshire; was
                educated at Eton, and elected a scholar of King’s college,
                Cambridge in 1507, where he took the degree of M. A.
                afterwards became proctor of the university, schoolmaster
                of Eton, fellow of the college, and at length provost. In
                1529 he retired to Oxford, where he was incorporated
                B. D. About the same time he was made archdeacon of Colchester. In 1534 he was installed canon of Windsor, and
                the same year he was appointed register of the most noble
                order of the garter. July 18, 1537, he was consecrated
                bishop of Carlisle. He wrote several pieces, particularly
                1. “<q>Epistola ad Gulielmum Hormannum.</q>” 2. “<q>Epigrammata varia.</q>” 3. “<q>Several Resolutions concerning the
                    Sacraments.</q>” 4. “<q>Answers to certain Queries concerning the Abuses of the Mass.</q>” He wrote also resolutions
                of seme questions relating to bishops and priests, and other
                matters tending to the reformation of the church begun by
                king Henry <sc>VIII</sc>. Leland was his familiar acquaintance,
                and gives him a 'high character for parts and learning.
                The prelate died March 25, 1555, at Horncastle, in Lincolnshire, which was a house belonging to the bishops of
                Carlisle.
            </p>
            <p>When he was senior proctor, he was employed by the
                university to write three letters to the king, and the following curious entry in the proctor’s book for 1527,
                proves this fac-L “<q>Magistro Aldryg pro tribus literis
                    missis ad Dominum regem, IDs.</q>” He was a correspondent of Erasmus, who termed him, when young, “<q>blandae
                    eloquentiae juvenis,</q>” and appears to have associated with
                him during his residence at Cambridge. Fuller is of
                opinion that he belongs to the light rather than the dark
                side of the reformation; but Strype seems to doubt whether he was well affected to this great change. He was
                certainly, however, not a persecutor; and the mildness or
                timidity of his disposition may account for his retaining
                his offices during reigns of opposite principles. It yet remains to be noticed that in 1523, he was one of the Cambridge university-preachers, who were sent out by the university to preach in different parts of the nation, as the
                judges now go their circuits; there being at. that time very
                few men of ability in any county.</p>

            <p>, a miscellaneous French
                writer of considerable note, was born at Grenoble in 1643,
                of Protestant parents, whose religion he abjured, and after
                tudying medicine, was admitted doctor at Aix. Having,
                however, failed in this profession, he came to Paris. Pelisson and father Bouhours were his friends here, but he
                offended the latter by obtaining from the abbe de la Chambre, a manuscript of Vaugelas, which he published under
                the title of “<q date="1690">Nouvelles remarques de M. de Vuugelas sur
                    la langue Franchise, ouvrage posthume, avec des observations de M. H.</q>” Paris, <date event="work">1690</date>, 12mo. Bouhours attacked the
                authenticity of this work, and Alemand promised to answer
                him, which we do not find that he performed. His other
                publications were, 1. “<q date="1688">Nouvelles Observations, ou Guerre
                    civile des Frangais sur la langue,</q>” <date event="work">1688</date>, 12mo, a kind of
                attempt towards a verbal and critical dictionary, which was
                to have been comprised in two vols. fol. but the French
                academy prevented its being published, for the -same reason, says Moreri, that they prevented that of Furetiere,
                namely, that the academicians intended to pubHsh a work
                of the kind themselves. 2. “<q date="1690">Histoire monastique d'lrelande,</q>” <date event="work">1690</date>, 12mo; which was afterwards enlarged by

            <p>, an antiquary of great learning, was born of Greek parents, Jan. 12, 1583, and educated
                in the Greek college founded by pope Gregory <sc>XIII</sc>.
                where he made a vast progress in learning, and was no less
                esteemed for the integrity of his morals. He afterwards
                entered into holy orders. He probably at first intended to
                settle in Greece, and applied to a.' Greek bishop, who ordained him a sub-deacon; but he afterwards changed his
                mind, and received the other sacred orders from the hands
                of the bishops of the Romish church. Erythneus, in his
                “<q>Pinacotheca,</q>” although a zealous Roman Catholic, insinuates, that in this change Alemanni was influenced by
                the prospect of interest. His fortune, however, being still
                inconsiderable, he employed himself in teaching the Greek
                language to several persons of distinguished rank, and
                gained the friendship of Scipio Cobellutius, who was at
                that time secretary of the briefs to pope Paul V. This
                paved the way for his obtaining the post of secretary to
                cardinal Borghese, which, however, he did not fill to the
                entire satisfaction of his employer, from his being more
                intimately conversant in Greek than Latin, and mixing
                Greek words in his letters. He was afterwards made keeper
                of the Vatican library, for which he was considered as
                amply qualified. He died July 24, 1626. His death is said
                to have been occasioned by too close an attendance on
                the erection of the great altar of the church of St. Peter
                at Rome. It was necessary for him to watch that no person
                should carry away any part of the earth dug up, which had
                been sprinkled with the blood of the martyrs, and in his
                care he contracted some distemper, arising from the vapours, which soon ended his days. He published “<q date="1663">Procopii Historic Arcana, Gr. et Lat. Nic. Alernanno interprete,

                and in 1676 entered the order of St. Ignatius. He was
                professor of philosophy, theology, and the belles lettres,
                at Cologn, until the year 1691. He was afterwards, in
                1701, invited to the university of Treves, where he gave
                his course of lectures on theology, and was appointed, in
                1703, regent of the gymnastic school, and about the same

            <p>, the most celebrated architect of his
                time, was born at Perusia in 1500, and died in 1572. His
                reputation was spread over almost all Europe. He furnished France, Spain, and Germany, with plans, not only
                for palaces and churches, but also for public fountains and
                baths, in which he displayed the fertility of his genius.
                The plan that brought him the most honour was that of
                the monastery and the church of the Escurial, which was
                adopted in preference to all that had been presented by
                the most able architects of Europe. Several cities and
                towns of Italy are also decorated by edifices of his construction; but there is not one where so many of them are seeu
                as at Genoa; the cupola of the cathedral and the Grimaldi
                and Pallavicini palaces are by him; and it is doubtless on
                account of the number of these magnificent monuments,
                that that city has merited the name of Genoa the superb.
                It is said, that Alessi was likewise verv learned, and had
                a capacity for managing concerns of the utmost importance.

            <p>, a young writer of very promising
                talents, was born in Ireland in 1736, whither his father, a
                dissenting teacher at Stratford upon Avon, had removed;
                and from whence, on his death, the widow and family
                returned to England. After having gone through a grammatical education, John was sent to the dissenting academy
                at Daventry, where he prosecuted his studies with commendable diligence, and was afterwards put under the tuition of Dr. Benson, who had sometimes young students
                under his care, after they had finished their university or
                academical education, for the purpose of instructing them
                in a more critical acquaintance with the sacred writings.
                He afterwards entered into the ministry, which he exercised in and near Birmingham, but principally at a small
                village called Longdon, about twelve miles from that place.
                On Saturday, Dec. 28, 1765, he returned to rest, in perfect health, between eleven and twelve o'clock, intending
                to officiate at Longdon next day but at six in the morning he was found dead in his bed; an event which was sincerely deplored by his friends, both as a private and a
                public loss.
            </p>
            <p>After his death, the rev. John Palmer of London published a work of his, entitled “<q>A Paraphrase upon the
                    15th chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians; with
                    critical notes and observations, and a Preliminary Dissertation, a Commentary, with critical Remarks, upon the
                    6th, 7th, and part of the 8th chapters to the Romans.</q>”
                To which is added, “<q date="1766">A Sermon on Ecclesiastes ix. 10.
                    composed by the author the day preceding his death,</q>” Lond.
                <date event="work">1766</date>, 4to. Mr. Palmer has bestowed high praise on the
                critical sagacity and learning displayed in this work. It is
                some deduction from its merit,' however, that, in the preliminary dissertation, he favours the opinion of there being
                no state of consciousness between death and the resurrection. Of his talents, in another respect, a much more
                favourable opinion may be formed from the papers he wrote
                in “<q>The Library,</q>” a monthly publication, conducted, if we
                mistake not, principally by Dr. Kippis. In this, Mr. Alexander wrote an ironical “<q>Defence of persecution, essays
                    on Dullness, Common Sense, Misanthropy, the Study df
                    Man, Controversy, the Misconduct of Parents, Modern
                    Authorship, the present state of Wit in Great Britain, the
                    Index of the Mind, and the Fate of periodical productions.</q>”
                In some of these he displays genuine humour, not inferior
                indeed to that of most of our celebrated Essayists. He
                appears to have been a man of great worth, learning, and
                modesty.

                involved in a quarrel, which obliged him to go to Spain,
                where he resided at Cordova. He contributed very much
                to the reputation of the academy of that place by his learning and works. He died at Lucena in 1103, at the age of
                ninety. His principal work is an abridgment of the Talmud, so highly esteemed by the Jews, that they study it
                more than the original, and call it the little Talmud. It
                has gone through many editions, some with the text only,

                philosopher, was born at Thous in 1058, studied in the
                college of the celebrated Iman-Al-Haremein, and became
                a man of great learning. On the death of his preceptor
                he presented himself to the vizir Neddham El-mulk, who
                bestowed many gifts and honours upon him, and gave him,
                the superintendance of a college which he had founded at
                Bagdad. Algazeli, after retaining this office four years,
                embraced a solitary life, travelled into Syria and Palestine,
                and employed himself in the composition of his works,
                until his death in 1111. Among his papers was a treatise
                censuring with great freedom some articles of the Mahometan faith; this was of course immediately committed to
                the flames. He left, however, many other works, some
                of which have been translated either into Latin or Hebrew.
                His treatise on “<q date="1506">Religious Sciences</q>” is highly celebrated
                in the East. In <date event="work">1506</date> was published at Cologn, another

            <p>, a French writer of considerable spirit,
                was born at Dole in 1600, appointed abbe of St. Paul at
                Besancon in 1632, and afterwards canon of the church of
                St. John in the same place. He defended the rights of
                his chapter, in the election of archbishops, with much
                firmness, against pope Alexander <sc>VII</sc>. and published several pieces on that subject about the year 1672. His “<q>Dialogue entre Porte Noire et la Pillori,</q>” a facetious composition, was censured by father Dominic Vernerey, inquisitor of Besancon; and this produced an answer from Alix,
                entitled “<q>Eponge pour effacer la censure du P. Dom.
                    Vernerey.</q>” This, as well as Alix’s other works, is very
                scarce. Le Long, in his historical library of France, attributes to him the “<q>History of the abb ay of St. Paul,</q>” but
                it is doubted whether his talents lay in that direction. He
                had, however, studied mathematics, and left some manuscripts on that subject, which have been lost. He died
                July 6, 1676.</p>

            <p>, a learned Dutch antiquary, was born in 1654, and amidst the duties of his office
                as first commissioner of convoys and licences, found leisure
                to publish many curious works. His first, in 1699, was a
                “<q>Dissertation on Tournaments,</q>” in which he treats of the
                ceremonies used at the court of Holland ti the days of
                chivalry. The third edition, published in 1740, by Peter
                van der Schelling, his son-in-law, had the addition of a
                dissertation on the origin, progress, and decline, of tournaments and single combats. Alkemade was afterwards
                editor of the metrical chronicle of Melis Sitoke, Leyden,
                1699, fol. containing a history of Holland to 1337, with
                engraved portraits of all the counts of Holland. In 1700,
                he published “<q>Muntspiegel der Graven van Holland,</q>” &amp;c.
                Delft, fol. a chronological series of coins struck under the
                reigns of the counts from Floris <sc>III</sc>. to Philip <sc>II</sc>. His next
                work was a treatise on modes of Burial, Delft, 1713, 8vo.
                This, he modestly says, is only an attempt which may perhaps excite others to investigate the subject more fully.
                But his princi[&gt;al work, and that which is most esteemed
                by his countrymen, was published in 1732, under the title
                of “<q>Nedenandsche Displechtigheden,</q>” 3 vols. 8va, a
                work not only extremely curious for its illustration of the
                ancient manners of the Dutch, but for the number of its
                beautiful engravings. His son-in-law assisted in completing and preparing this work for the press. After publishing some other works of less note, he concluded his
                literary labours by a description of the town of Brill, and
                died in 1737, at the advanced age of eighty-three.</p>

            <p>, or rather <csc>Allen</csc> (<csc>Thomas</csc>), a pious English
                divine, was born about 1682, and educated at Wadham
                college, Oxford, where he probably took only his bachelor’s degree, as we do not find him in the list of upper
                graduates. In 1714 he was presented to the rectory of
                Kettering, in Northamptonshire, on which he resided the
                whole of his life, and was exemplary in all the duties of
                the pastoral office, nor less indefatigable as a writer, although his success in this last character bore little proportion to the magnitude of his labours. Of his printed works
                we know only, 1. “<q date="1716">The Practice of an Holy Life; or the
                    Christian’s Daily Exercise, in Meditations, Prayer, &amp;c.</q>”
                London, <date event="work">1716</date>, 8vo. 2. “<q>The Christian’s sure Guide to
                    Eternal Glory,</q>” both popular works, and afterwards translated into the Russian language. 3. “<q date="1744">A Sermon before
                    the Criminals in Newgate,</q>” <date event="work">1744</date>. 4. “<q date="1753">The New Birth,
                    or Christian Regeneration, in Miltonic or blank verse,</q>”
                <date event="work">1753</date>, 8vo. Besides these, he wrote “<q>Pandects of Christianity</q>” “<q>The harmony and agreement between Moses
                    and Christ</q>” “<q>The Primitive and Apostolic Fathers, with
                    their genuine Writings</q>” “<q>God the best interpreter of his
                    law</q>” “<q>The Divine Worship and Service of the Church
                    of England,</q>” with some others, for which he issued
                proposals, but was obliged to desist from want of encouragement. Lists of these <csc>Mss</csc>. he sent to various clergymen, requesting they would bear the expence, &amp;c.; and
                accompanied them with letters in an eccentric style, and
                with no small portion of conceit. Mr. Allen died May 31,
                1755, suddenly, as he was reading prayers in his church.</p>

            <p>, an English lawyer and antiquary,
                was born at Great Hadham in Hertfordshire, about the end
                of the seventeenth century, and was educated at Eton;
                whence he went to King’s college, Cambridge, and took
                his bachelor’s degree in 1707, and his master’s in 1711.
                He afterwards studied law, was called to the bar, and by
                the influence of Arthur Onslow, speaker of the house of
                commons, became a master in chancery. His reputation
                as a lawyer was inconsiderable, but he was esteemed a good
                classical scholar, and a man of wit and convivial habits.
                He became afterwards an alderman of the corporation of
                Guildford, and an useful magistrate in that neighbourhood.
                He died April 11, 1754, and was buried in the Temple
                church. He collected a biographical account of the members of Eton college, which by his will, dated 1753, he ordered to be placed in the libraries of the two colleges, and
                a third copy to be given to his patron, Mr. Onslow. He
                also compiled, at his leisure hours, or rather made collections for, an English dictionary of obsolete words, of words
                which have changed their meaning, as villain, knave, and of
                proverbial or cant words, as helter-skelter, which he derived
                from hiiariter cderiter. It is not known what became of
                this manuscript. He bequeathed his fortune, and probably
                his books, to a brother who was a Turkey merchant.</p>

                from thence removed to Brazen-nose college, Oxford,
                1589. He was elected a probationer fellow of Merton college in 1593. He afterwards went into orders; but, instead
                of preaching, he applied himself to the more abstruse and
                critical parts of learning. This recommended him to the
                esteem of sir Henry Savile, by whose interest he obtained
                a fellowship of Eton college in 1604, and whom he assisted
                in his elaborate edition of St. Chrysostom. While at Eton,
                he assisted the studies of Dr. Hammond, then a school-boy,
                particularly in the Greek language. He wrote “<q>Observationes in libellum Chrysostomi in Esaiam.</q>” He died
                Oct. 10, 1638, and was buried in Eton college chapel.

            <p>, a celebrated Piedmontese physician, and professor of -Botany, in the university of Turin,
                was born in 1725, and died in 1804. On account of his
                high reputation for learning, he was elected a member of
                many scientific societies, such as the institute of Bologna,
                and the royal societies of London, Montpellier, Gottingen,
                Madrid, &amp;c. Of his numerous medical and botanical publications, the following are the principal: 1, “<q date="1755">Pedemontii
                    stirpium rariorum specimen primum,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">1755</date>, 4to,
                containing the description and figures of thirty plants,
                either new or little known, which grow on the mountains of Piedmont. 2. “<q date="1757">OryctographiiE Pedemontan;e
                    specimen,</q>” Paris, <date event="work">1757</date>, 8vo; an account of the fossils
                in Piedmont. 3. “<q date="1758">Tractatio de miliarium origine, progressu, natura, et curatione,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">1758</date>, 8vo; a medical treatise much esteemed. 4. “<q>Stirpium præcipuarum
                    littoris et agri Nicaeensis enumeratio methodica, cum
                    elencho aliquot animalium ejusdem maris,</q>” Paris, 1757,
                8vo. This work is often quoted by naturalists under the
                abridged title of “<q>Enumeratio stirpium Nicaeensis.</q>” The
                principal part of it was collected by John Giudice, a botanist at Nice, and a friend of Allioni, to whom he bequeathed his papers. 5. “<q date="1762">Synopsis methodica horti Taurinensis,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">1762</date>, 4to, a methodical catalogue of the
                plants in the botanic garden of Turin, divided into thirteen classes. 6. “<q date="1785">Flora Pedemontana, sive enumeratio
                    methodica stirpium indigenarum Pedemontii,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">1785</date>,
                3 vols. fol. This splendid work, which is illustrated with
                ninety-two plates, was the fruit of long labour and study,
                and added greatly to the author’s reputation. In it he
                describes 2813 plants, which he found growing wild in the
                duchy of Piedmont, of which those in the third volume
                are new. It has been, however, said, that those already
                known acquire a kind of novelty by his descriptions, which
                are drawn from nature, and not from books; and the work
                derives an additional value, especially on the spot, from
                the very cautious manner in which he speaks of the medical properties of any of these plants. The arrangement
                resembles that of Haller in his history of the Swiss plants.
                Haller had a great regard for Allioni, and corresponded
                with him till his death. 7. “<q date="1789">Auctuarium ad Flora Pedemontana,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">1789</date>, containing some additions and
                corrections to the former. Besides these works, he wrote
                several papers in the memoirs of the academy of Turin;
                and from all his writings seems to deserve an honourable
                place among those who have contributed to the advancement of the botanical and medical sciences. Loeffling
                consecrated a genus to his memory, under the name of
                Allionia, which Linnæus has adopted. It is a genus of
                the monogynia order belonging to the tetrandria class of
                plants.</p>

                painter of history and portraits, received his education in
                the school of the Caracci, and in all his compositions retained the admirable style of his master. He had naturally
                a melancholy turn of mind, and was of a retired and solitary disposition: this induced him to avoid the conversation of his friends, and devote himself to the study of his
                art; but by this plan he became so necessitous, that he was
                compelled to paint portraits to procure a subsistence. In
                this branch, however, his success was astonishing; and he
                grew into the highest esteem, not only for the resemblance
                visible at first sight, and the beauty of his colouring, but
                also for a new and unusual boldness of manner, by which
                his portraits seemed absolutely to breathe. None of his
                contemporaries could enter into competition with him; and
                the Italian writers place him in the same rank of merit with
                Vandvck. He was born at Bologna in 1578, and died in

            <p>, called <csc>Bronzing</csc>, an eminent
                painter, was born at Florence in 1535, and was the disciple
                of Agnolo Bronzino, likewise a distinguished painter, who
                educated him with all the tenderness of a parent, Allori
                having been deprived of his own father, when he was but
                five years old. He was very studious, and applied himself
                diligently, not only to imitate the manner of his master,
                but the different manners of those masters who were in the
                greatest reputation. When he commenced painter, his
                first work was a crucifixion, intended for an altar-piece,
                which was much praised, but his success in portrait-painting induced him to employ a great deal of his time in that
                branch. Michael Angelo was the master whose works he
                studied with the greatest attention, and he designed a picture of the Last Judgment, after the manner of that great
                genius, which is preserved at Rome, and will perpetuate
                the honour of Allori. He died in 1607, aged 72. It is
                said that he wrote some burlesque poems, and a dialogue
                on Design. The existence of this last is denied by his
                French biographer, but we find its title in Haym’s Biblioteca Italiana, “<q date="1590">Dialogo di Alessandro Allori pittore Florentine sopra l'arte del disegnare le figure principiando da

                after an education among the Jesuits, was sent to the Indies, where, having completed his studies, he became rector of the college of Bacaim. In 1622, Vitteleschi, general of the Jesuits, sent him as ambassador to the king of
                Abyssinia, who received him with much respect; but his
                successor having banished the Jesuits from his dominions,
                Almeida returned to Goa in 1634, and became provincial
                of his order in India, and inquisitor. He died at Goa in

            <p>, a Portugueze priest, who had
                the courage in Portugal to study and teach philosophy,
                xipon more rational and experimental principles than had
                ever been known in that country, was born in 1722. His
                most celebrated work, written in Portuguese, and entitled
                “<q>Itecreaceo Filosofica,</q>” 5 vols. 8vo, 1751, occasioned a
                revolution in the philosophical studies of the Portugueze,
                and would probably have involved the author in much
                danger, had not the Jesuits been soon after banished from
                that kingdom. He was nevertheless a zealous advocate
                for the pretensions of the court of Rome, at the time of
                the famous rupture between Joseph <sc>II</sc>. and that court; and
                this rendered him so obnoxious to the marquis de Pombal,
                that he was obliged to seek an asylum in France, during
                the ministry of that nobleman. On his return to Portugal,
                the royal academy of sciences of Lisbon was eager to
                admit him a member; but it was soon evident that Almeida
                had not kept pace with the progress which the nation had
                made in twenty-five years, and he was suffered to eclipse
                himself, although without losing any of the respect due to
                his former services in promoting liberal science. He published, after his return to Lisbon, a moral romance, called
                “<q>The Happy Independant,</q>” which had little success;
                and it was said that a better title would have been “<q date="1805">The
                    Happy Impertinent.</q>” He died in <date event="work">1805</date>, leaving behind
                him several manuscripts, for the publication of which he
                had obtained the permission of the Censor. His works
                altogether are said to amount to forty volumes, besides
                five of translations; but we have not been able to obtain a
                list of their titles or subjects. At the time of his death he
                was a member of the Royal Academy of Lisbon, and of
                the Royal Society of London.</p>

            <p>, a priest of the oratory, was
                born at Brescia, of a noble family, Nov. 2, 1714, and
                studied theology, and the Greek and Hebrew languages,
                in both which he became an excellent scholar. He applied himself chiefly to an investigation of the text of the
                sacred scriptures, and read with great care the Greek and
                Latin fathers. His studies were also diversified by an acquaintance with chronology, history both sacred and profane, antiquities, criticism, and whatever belongs to the
                character of a general scholar. In his own country, he
                obtained such fame that his advice was thought to be oracular. He died Dec. 30, 1779, in his sixty-fifth year. He
                published “<q>Critical Reflexions</q>” on Febronius’s work, entitled “<q>De Statu Ecclesiae, et legitima potestate Romani
                    Pontificis^</q>” some dissertations and other works, particularly one on the “<q>manner of writing the lives of illustrious
                    characters,</q>” with an appendix on that peculiar species of
                biography, writing one’s own life. He left also some unpublished works, and among them “<q>a comparison between
                    the Italians and French,</q>” and “<q>Thoughts on the life and
                    writings of father Paul Sarpi.</q>”</p>

        <body>
            <p>, king of Leon and Castile, who has
                been surnamed The Wise, on account of his attachment
                to literature, is now more celebrated for having been an
                astronomer than a king. He was born in 1203, succeeded
                his father Ferdinand <sc>III</sc>. in 12S2, and died in 1284, consequently at the age of 81. The affairs of the reign of
                Alphon&amp;us were very extraordinary and unfortunate, but
                we shall here only consider him in that part of his
                character, on account of which he has a place in this
                work, namely, as an astronomer and a man of letters. He
                acquired a profound knowledge of astronomy, philosophy,
                and history, and composed books upon the motions of the
                heavens, and on the history of Spain, which are highly
                commended. “<q>What can be more surprising,</q>” says Mariana, “<q>than that a prince, educated in a camp, and
                    handling arms from his childhood, should have such a
                    knowledge of the stars, of philosophy, and the transactions
                    of the world, as men of leisure can scarcely acquire in
                    their retirements? There are extant some books of Alphonsus on the motions of the stars, and the history of Spain,
                    written with great skill and incredible care.</q>” In his astronomical pursuits he discovered that the tables of Ptolemy
                were full of errors, and was the first to undertake the task
                of correcting them. For this purpose, about the year 1240,
                and during the life of his father, he assembled at Toledo
                the most skilful astronomers of his time, Christians, Moors,
                or Jews, when a plan was formed for constructing new
                tables. This task was accomplished about 1252, the first
                year of his reign; the tables being drawn up chiefly by the
                skill and pains of Rabbi Isaac Ha/an, a learned Jew, and
                the work called the Alphonsine Tables, in honour of the
                prince, who was at vast expences concerning them. He
                fixed the epoch of the tables to the 30th of May 1252,
                being the day of his accession to the throne. They were
                printed for the first time in 1483, at Venice, by Radtolt,
                who excelled in printing at that time; an edition extremely
                rare: there are others of 1492, 1521, 1545, &amp;c.
            </p>
            <p>We must not omit a memorable saying of Alphonsus,
                which has been recorded for its boldness and impiety;
                namely, “<q>That if he had been of God’s privy council when
                    he made the world, he could have advised him better.</q>”
                His biographers have endeavoured to vindicate him in this
                instance, by assuring us that he meant only to reflect on.
                the absurd philosophy by which the laws of nature were
                then explained. Perhaps their wiser course would have
                been to consign it to oblivion, as there is no direct proof
                of his not having used this irreverent language.</p>

        <body>
            <p>, the reviver of industry and
                commerce in Sweden, was born in 1685, in the small town
                of Alingsas in West Gothland, of poor parents. After
                struggling for a long time with the evils of want, he came
                to London, where he paid particular attention to commercial speculations; and from his inquiries into the prosperity of England, he deduced the importance of manufactures and commerce. His native country, for several
                centuries engaged in war, had made little progress in the
                arts of industry, but was now endeavouring to promote
                them; and Alstroemer having formed his plan, returned
                to Sweden to assist his fellow-citizens in this undertaking.
                In 1723, he requested of the states a licence to establish
                manufactures in the town in which he was born, and it
                soon became the seat of activity and industry, which spread
                over other parts of the kingdom. In the mean time he
                travelled to acquire a knowledge of the inventions and the
                methods practised in Germany, Holland, and Flanders,
                collected able workmen, and the best models, and published several instructive papers. At the same time he
                carried on trade, in partnership with Nicholas Sahlgren,
                at Gottenburgh. Here he established a sugar-house,
                traded to the Indies and the Levant, and bestowed so much
                attention on rural opconomy, as to introduce some very
                essential improvements, cultivating plants proper for
                dying, and extending the culture of potatoes, then a novelty in Sweden. He also improved the wool-trade by
                importing the sheep of Spain and England, and even the
                Angora goat. The manufacture of cloth, and other articles from wool, was now much encouraged, and gave
                employment to a great number of hands, who manufactured to the value of three millions of livres tournois per
                annum, and relieved the country from the necessity of
                having recourse to foreign markets; but in other manufactures, as the silk, then did not succeed so well. Alstroemer has been accused of not paying sufficient attention to local circumstances in some of his schemes, and of
                having encouraged notions that were more showy than
                solid; but his design was truly patriotic, and his country
                readily acknowledged the benefit it has derived from his
                labours. The king Frederic bestowed on him the title of
                counsellor of commerce, and the order of the polar star;
                Adolphus Frederic granted him letters of nobility; and the
                academy of sciences chose him a member, while the States
                decreed that his statue should be placed on the exchange
                at Stockholm, with this inscription: “<q>Jonas Alstjoemer,
                    artium fabrilium in patria instaurator.</q>” “<q date="1761">J. A. the reviver
                    of manufactures.</q>” He died in <date event="work">1761</date>, leaving a
                considerable fortune. His four sons, Claude, Patrick, John,
                Augustus, were distinguished for talents and patriotism,
                and the first three were members of the academy of Stockholm.</p>

                born in 1736, studied natural history, and was a pupil of
                Linnseus. He travelled over a considerable part of Europe, beginning with Spain, whence he sent some plants
                to Linnæus, who mentions him in his “<q>Species plantaruni.</q>”
                On landing at Cadiz, he saw in the house of the Swedish
                consul the flowers of a plant, a native of Peru. Struck
                with their beauty, he asked and obtained some seeds, which
                he immediately dispatched to Linnseus, with whom they
                succeeded, and became generally cultivated under the
                name of the lily of Alstroetner, or of the Incas. Linnæus
                perpeiuated the name by -Galling the genus Alstrpemeria.
                Alstroemer communicated with several societies for agriculture and natural history, but one paper only is mentioned of his in the memoirs of the academy of Stockholm,
                giving a description of the Simia Mammon, a species of,
                ape. He died in 1794.</p>

            <p>, a German classical scholar
                critic, was born at Englesberg, in Silesia, in 1749,
                and died at Vienna March 29, 1804. He entered the society of the Jesuits, and was Greek teacher in the school
                of St. Anne, and the academy of Vienna, until his death.
                He has published two hundred and fifty volumes and dissertations, the titles of which are given in J. G. Meusel’s
                Allemagne Savante. One of his principal publications was
                “<q date="1786">Novum Testamentum, ad codicem Vindobonensem
                    Græce expressum: varietatem lectionis addidit Franc.
                    C. Alter.</q>” vol. I. <date event="work">1786</date>, vol. <sc>II</sc>. 1787, 8vo. The groundwork of this edition is the codex Lambecii in the imperial
                library at Vienna, with which the author has collated other
                manuscripts in that library, and the Coptic, Sclavonic, and
                Latin versions; the latter from the valuable fragments of
                the Vulgate, anterior to that of Jerome. It is thought
                that he would have succeeded better, if he had adopted
                as a basis the text of Wetstein or Griesbach, and if he had
                been more fortunate in arranging his materials. The
                merits of this edition are examined, with his usual acuteness, by Dr. Herbert Marsh in his supplement to Michaelis’s
                introduction to the New Testament. Of Alter’s other
                works, those in most esteem abroad are: 1. A German
                translation of Harwood’s View of the various editions of
                the Classics, with notes, Vienna, 1778, 8vo. 2. Various
                readings from the manuscripts in the imperial library, which
                he used in the editions printed at Vienna, of Lysias, 1785 j

                1787, 8vo; Homeri Ilias, 1789—1790, 2 vols.; also with
                various readings from the Palatine library; Homeri Odyssea and min. poem. 1794. 3. Some of Plato’s Dialogues,
                1784, 8vo. 4. Thucydides, 1785, 8vo. 5. The Greek
                Chronicle of George Phranza or Phranzes, not before

                history of Georgia, in German, 1798, 8vo. His numerous
                essays and dissertations, which are upon curious and recondite subjects, illustrations of Oriental and Greek manuscripts, &amp;c. have appeared in the German literary

            <p>, a Swiss historian and divine, was born in 1697, and, according to one authority, at
                Berne, where his father had been rector; or. according to
                another at Zofinguen, and died in 1758, curate of Inns, a
                village in the canton of Berne. In 1735 he was appointed
                moral and Greek professor at Berne, and afterwards published some valuable works on the geography, history, and
                antiquities of Swisserland. In conjunction with Breitinger,

            <p>, a

                architect to the town, where he died in 1578. His merit as
                a painter appears to have been very considerable, but much
                more as a designer and engraver. His works in wood and
                metal are as numerous as, in general, remarkable for diminutive size, though neither his conceptions nor forms were
                puny. The cuts“<q>of</q>” The Passion,“<q/>” Jaei and Siserah,“<q/>”Pyramus and Thisbe,“<q/>” Judah and Thamar,"<!--*BLOB*--> if we allow for the ignorance of costume in the three last, show a
                sensibility of mind, and a boldness of design, which perhaps none of his German contemporaries can boast. Holbein is said to have drawn great assistance from him,
                evident traces of the style of Altorfer appearing in the
                prints of that inimitable artist, although certainly much

            <p> a Prussian statesman, knight of the orders of the red and black
                eagle, lord of Hundisburgh, &amp;c. was born Dec. 12, 1745,
                at Hanover, where his father was counsellor of war. During the seven years war he was brought up at Magdebourg
                with the prince, afterwards Frederic-William <sc>II</sc>. He then
                studied law at the university of Halle, and was appointed
                referendary in the court of accounts at Berlin, and in 1775,
                was sent as envoy extraordinary to the elector of Saxony,
                with the title of king’s chamberlain. This proved the
                commencement of a diplomatic career, for which he was
                thought qualified by his extensive knowledge and accomplishments, and the address with which he retained the
                good opinion of Frederic <sc>II</sc>. During the war for the succession of Bavaria, he acted as intermediate agent between
                the king of Prussia and the old electorate court, and between the army of Frederic and that of Prince Henry.
                After having been engaged in this office for twelve years,
                he was sent as ambassador, in 1787, to the court of France.
                In 1788 he was sent, in the same capacity, to Holland and
                in 1789 to England. In 1790 he was recalled from the
                latter, and appointed minister for foreign affairs, and his
                zeal and activity rendered him highly acceptable in the
                court of Berlin. During his administration he founded
                several benevolent establishments. He died at Berlin in
                1802. As a writer he is known by a historical work entitled “<q date="1792">Essai d‘un tableau chronologique des evenements

            <p> a modern German
                poet, was born at Vienna, Jan. 24, 1755; his father was a
                civilian, and consistory counsellor to the bishop of Passau,
                He studied the classics under the celebrated antiquary
                Eckhel, keeper of the medals at Vienna, and while with
                him, imbibed such a taste for reading-the ancient poets,
                that he knew most of their writings by heart, and was always so fond of this study, that he remembered with gratitude, to the last hour of his life, the master who had initiated him in it, nor did he neglect his favourite authors,
                even when obliged to attend the courts of law. When the
                death of his parents had put him in possession of a considerable patrimony, he made no other use of his doctor’s and advocate’s titles, than in reconciling the differences of such
                clients as addressed themselves to him for advice. His first
                poetical attempts appeared in the Muses’ Almanack, and
                other periodical publications at Vienna, and of these he
                published a collection at Leipsic in 1784, and at Klagenfurth in 1788, which procured him the honour of being
                ranked among the best poets of his country for elegance,
                energy, and fertility of imagination. In the “<q date="1794">New Collection of Poetry,</q>” printed at Vienna in <date event="work">1794</date>, he contributed some pieces not so favourable to his character; but
                he completely re-established his fame by the publication
                of “<q>Doolin of Mentz,</q>” and “<q>Bliomberis,</q>” two poems of
                the romantic cast, in imitation of.Wieland, to whom the
                last was dedicated. In 1791, he published a German translation of Florian’s “<q>Numa Pompilius,</q>” which some have
                thought equal to the original, but in many parts it is deficient in elegance. It was, however, his last performance,
                except the assistance he gave to some literary contemporaries in translating the foreign journals. During the three
                last years of his life, he was secretary and inspector of the&gt;
                court theatre, and died May 1, 1797, of a nervous fever.
                He was a man of warm affections and gaiety of temper, and
                of his liberality he afforded a striking instance in the case
                of Haschka the poet, whom he regarded as one of the
                cipal supporters of German literature. He not only ac
                commodated him with apartments in his house, but made
                him a present of 10,000 florins. Of his faults, it is only
                recorded that he was a little vain, and a little given to the
                pleasures of the table.</p>

            <p>, the son of Gregory Amaseo, Latin professor at Venice, was one of the most celebrated
                Italian scholars of the sixteenth century. He was born at
                Udina in 1489, and educated at first by his father and
                uncle, but finished his studies at Padua, and in 1508 had
                begun to teach the belles lettres there, when the war, occasioned by the league at Cambray, obliged him to leave
                the place. He then went to Bologna, continued to teach,
                and married, and had children, and was so much respected
                that the city admitted him as a citizen, an honour which
                his ancestors had also enjoyed. In 1530, he was appointed
                first secretary to the senate, and was chosen by pope Clement <sc>VII</sc>. to pronounce before him and Charles V. a Latin
                harangue on the subject of the peace concluded at Bologna between the two sovereigns. This he accordingly
                performed, with great applause, in the church of St. Petrona, before a numerous audience of the first rank. He
                continued to teach at Bologna, with increasing popularity,
                until 1543, when he was invited to Rome by pope Paul <sc>III</sc>.
                and his nephew cardinal Alexander Farnese. The pope employed him in many political missions to the court of the
                emperor, those of the German princes, and that of the king
                of Poland; and in 1550, after the death of his wife, pope
                Julius <sc>III</sc>. appointed him secretary of the briefs, a place
                which he did not long enjoy, as he died in 1552. He wrote
                Latin translations of “<q date="1533">Xenophon’s Cyrus,</q>” Bologna, <date event="work">1533</date>,
                fol. and of “<q date="1547">Pausanias,</q>” Rome, <date event="work">1547</date>, 4to; and a volume
                entitled “<q>Orationes,</q>” consisting of eighteen Latin speeches
                on various occasions, Bonon. 1580, 4to. His contemporaries bestow the highest praises on his learning and
                eloAlienee. His son <csc>Pompilio</csc> had perhaps less reputation,
                but he too distinguished himself as Greek professor at Bologna, where he died in 1584. He translated two fragments of Polybius, Bologna, 1543, and wrote a history of
                his own time in Latin, which has not been published.</p>

            <p>, a miscellaneous French writer,
                who, in his works, assumed the title of signior de Chevillon, was the natural son of Chaumont d'Amboise,
                admiral of France, and lieutenant-general in Lombarcly. He
                was born at Naples in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and was educated with the legitimate son of hig
                father, but the latter died suddenly, in 1511, before he
                had made any provision for Michael. He then went to
                Paris, and was intended for the profession of the law, but
                was so attached to poetry, although his first performances
                were unsuccessful, that he could not be prevailed on to
                study law, and his friends abandoned him. He married
                also imprudently, and his accumulated disappointments
                and distresses are supposed to have shortened his life. He
                died in 1547. Niceron has given a large catalogue of his
                works, all nominally poetical, but without any characteristics of the art, and which probably procured him some
                small degree of reputation, chiefly from the rapidity with
                which he wrote and published.</p>

            <p>, an eminent Italian scholar, was born at Florence, June 13, 1713, and died at Rome
                in 1788, where he had been professor of eloquence for
                thirty years with great reputation. Most of the present
                Italian literati are indebted to him for their taste for study
                and the happy manner in which he taught them to employ
                their talents. He published a “<q>Translation of Virgil into
                    blank verse,</q>” of which the edition printed at Rome, 3 vols.
                fol. 1763, a most superb book, is very scarce: he translated likewise some of the tragedies of Voltaire, Florence,
                1752, and a selection of Cicero’s epistles; he published
                a Latin oration on the election of Joseph <sc>II</sc>. to be king of
                the Romans; but he is principally known for the “<q>Museum Kicheranum,</q>” in 2 vols. folio, 1765. The care of
                this valuable museum was long confided to him, and he
                prevailed upon the learned cardinal De Zelada to enrich it
                by his collections. He left in manuscript, a Latin poem
                on the cultivation of the lemon-tree. One other publication remains to be noticed; his translation of the Jesuit
                Noceti’s two poems on the Iris and the Aurora Borealis,
                which were printed in the same magnificent manner with

                St. Saviour, near Bareges, at the age of 70. His order
                was sensible to his merit, and he was successively professor of theology, guardian, and definitor. His tract on
                “<q>Inward Peace,</q>” and his “<q>Lettres Spirituelles,</q>” each
                in one vol. 12mo, are said by persons of his communion,
                to be full of light and unction, and breathe that gentle
                piety that characterised their author. We are told by pere
                Mayeul, that he had great talents as a spiritual director,
                and was an instrument in the hand of God for converting
                sinners, and consoling the just. Fere Ambrose had by
                nature a self-love by far too sensible, with an exuberance
                of delicacy, and an ardent desire of public esteem: but an
                adherence to the precepts of the gospel effectually cured
                him of all these defects. To his native pride he opposed
                humility and self-contempt. “<q>It is self-love,</q>” said he,
                “<q>that corrupts our virtues, and spoils our happiness. Of
                    a hundred things that offend us in society, ninety-nine
                    were never meant to offend. But pride takes all things in
                    their strictest rigour.</q>” “<q>Let it take things,</q>” added he,
                “<q>as it will; I will suffer all. If they should spit in my
                    face, have I not a handkerchief to wipe it off?</q>”</p>

            <p>, an Italian lawyer and miscellaneous writer, was born at Naples in 1659, and for the first
                fourteen years of his life, was obliged to be confined in a
                dark room, owing to a complaint in his eyes. On his recovery, he made very rapid progress in general science,
                went through a course of law, and had very considerable
                practice at Naples. His leisure hours he dedicated to polite literature, and particularly cultivated the Tuscan language, which he wrote with the greatest purity, and used
                in all his works. He died at Naples, July 21, 1719. His
                principal writings are, 1. Seven prose comedies, La Costanza, H Forca, la Fante, &amp;c. which are, Baretti says, perhaps the wittiest we have in Italian; but the author makes
                some of his actors appear masked and speak the different
                dialects of Italy, especially the Neapolitan. 2. “<q date="1710">Rapporti

            <p>, a learned Jesuit, born atf
                Anzo in Lucania in 1562, was professor of philosophy
                and theology in the college at Naples, and its president
                for some years. He died in 1649. His fame, as far as
                he can now be allowed a share, rests principally on a voluminous work on the writings of Aristotle, entitled “<q>In
                    universam Aristotelis philosophiam notae et disputationes,
                    quibus illustriuna scholarum, Averrois, D. Thomae, Scoti,

            <p>, a Swiss physician, born at
                Schaffhausen in 1669, applied himself particularly to the
                teaching of those to speak who were born deaf, and acquired great reputation for this talent both in France and
                Holland, as well as in his own country. He published
                the method he had employed, in two small tracts, which
                are curious, and much sought after: one under the title of
                “<q date="1692">Surdus loquens,</q>” Harlemii, <date event="work">1692</date>, 8vo; the other,
                “<q date="1700">De Loquela,</q>” Amst. <date event="work">1700</date>, 12mo; which last, translated
                into French, is inserted in Deschamps’ “<q>Cours d'education
                    des sourds et muets,</q>” 1779, 12tno. Amman also published a good edition of the works of Ccelius Aurelianus,
                1709, 4to, with Janson D'Almeloveen’s notes. He died
                at Marmund, in Holland, in 1724. His son, <csc>John</csc>, born
                in 1707, was also a physician, but particularly skilled in
                Botany, on which he gave lectures at Petersburgh, where
                he was elected a member of the academy of sciences.
                He was also a member of the Royal Society of London.
                Being desirous of extending the knowledge of those plants
                which Gmelin and other travellers had discovered in the

            <p>, a painter and engraver,
                was born at Zurich, June 1539. His youth and studies
                are involved in obscurity, and the first notice we have of
                him is in 1560, when he went to Nuremberg, where he was
                admitted a burgess, and where he died in 1591. Here he
                began in designs on wood, paper, and copper, that career
                of incessant and persevering exertion which over-ran all
                Germany. History, allegory, emblem, sciences, trades,
                arts, professions, rural sports, heraldry, portrait, fashions,
                were all served in their turns, and often served so well,
                that his inventions may still be consulted by the artist with
                advantage. He painted with great brilliancy on glass.
                His drawings hatched with the pen, or washed, have Italian
                characteristics of style and execution.
            </p>
            <p>The multitude of designs which he made, and the number of plates which he engraved, are incredible. He lived
                at a time when almost every book which made its appearance was ornamented with prints, and he was employed
                mostly by the great booksellers, especially by Feyeraband.
                There are editions of Livy, Tacitus, Diogenes Laertius,
                and many other classics, with his prints. His portraits of
                the kings of France, with short memoirs, appeared in
                1576. He engraved also for the New Testament, and a
                “<q date="1586">Theatrum nmlierum,</q>” Francfort, <date event="work">1586</date>, 4to. One of
                his most curious works is the “<q date="1564">Panoplia omnium liberalium,
                    mechanic-drum et sedentiarium artium genera continens,</q>”
                Francfort, <date event="work">1564</date>, a collection of one hundred and fifteen
                plates, exhibiting the various artificers at work. In the
                plate of the art of engraving, he introduced a portrait of
                himself.</p>

            <p>, a learned German physician and
                botanist, was born at Breslaw in 1634. After studying in
                various German universities, he travelled to Holland and
                England, received his doctor’s degree at Leipsic, and was
                admitted a member of the society of natural history
                (l'academie de curieux de la nature) under the 1 name of
                Dryander. In 1674, an extraordinary professorship was
                established for him, from which he-was promoted to that
                of botany, and in 1682, to that of physiology. Amman
                was a man of a lively and somewhat turbulent cast, and
                although all his writings discover great learning and talents
                in his profession, yet he is often harsh in his remarks on
                others, fond of paradox, and affects a jocular humour not
                very well suited to the nature of the subjects on which he
                treats. His first work was a critical extract from the different decisions in the registers of the faculty of Leipsic,
                Erfurt, 1670, 4to; on which they thought proper to pass
                a public censure, in their answer published in the same
                year, under the title “<q>Facultatis medicse Lipsiensis excusatio, &amp;c.</q>” His other productions were, 1. “<q date="1673">Paraenesis
                    ad docentes occupata circa institutionum medicarum emendationem,</q>” Rudulstadt, <date event="work">1673</date>, 12mo, a vehement invective against medical systems, especially the Galenic, in
                which he certainly points out errors and abuses; but, as
                Haller observes, without pointing out any thing better.
                Leichner and others wrote against this work, whom he answered, in 2. “<q date="1674">Archaeas syncopticus, Eccardi Leichneri,
	  &amp;c. oppositus,</q>” <date event="work">1674</date>, 12mo. 3. “<q date="1689">Irenicum Numae Pompilii cum Hippocrate, quo veterum medicorum et philosophorum hypotheses, &amp;c. a prseconceptis opinionibus
                    vindicantur,</q>” Francfort, <date event="work">1689</date>, 8vo, a work of a satirical
                cast, and much in the spirit of the former. 4, “<q date="1690">Praxis
                    vulnerurn lethalium,</q>” Francfort, <date event="work">1690</date>, 8vo. As a botanist, he published a description of the garden at Leipsic,
                and “<q date="1676">Character naturalis plantarum,</q>” <date event="work">1676</date>, a work which,
                entitles him to rank among those who have most ably contributed to the advancement of the science of botany as
                we now have it. Nebel published an improved edition of
                this work in 1700. Amman, whom, we may add, Haller
                characterises as a man of a caustic turn, and somewhat
                conceited, died in 1691, in his fifty-fifth year.</p>

            <p>, a celebrated architect
                and sculptor, was born at Florence in 1511, and was at first
                the scholar of Baccio Bandinelli, and then of Sansovino
                at Venice; but on his return to his own country, he studied
                with much enthusiasm the sculptures of Michael Angelo in
                the chapel of St. Laurence. His first works are at Pisa;
                for Florence he executed a Leda, and about the same time,
                for Naples, the three figures, large as life, on the tomb of
                the poet Sannazarius. Meeting with some unpleasant circumstances here, he returned to Venice, and made the
                colossal Neptune, which is in St. Mark’s place. At Padua
                he made another colossal statue, of Hercules, which is still
                in the Montava palace, and has been engraved. He then
                went to Rome to study the antique, and pope Julius <sc>III</sc>.
                employed him in works of sculpture in the capitol. Some
                time after, in conjunction withVasari, he erected the tomb
                of cardinal de Monti, which added very considerably to his
                fame. Besides these, he executed a great number of
                works for Rome, Florence, and other places. The porticoes of the court of the palace Pitti are by him, as well as
                the bridge of the Trinity, one of the finest structures that
                have been raised since the revival of the arts, the facade of
                the Roman college, and the palace Rupsoli on the Corso.
                This architect composed a large work, entitled “<q>La Cita,</q>”
                comprising designs for all the public edifices necessary to a
                great city. This book, after having passed successively
                through several hands, was presented some time in the
                eighteenth century to prince Ferdinand of Tuscany, and
                it is now among the collection of designs in the gallery of
                Florence, after having been long inquired after, and supposed to be lost. After the death of his wife, he devoted
                the greater part of his wealth to pious purposes, and died
                himself in 1592. His wife, Laura Battiferri, an Italian
                lady of distinguished genius and learning, was the daughter of John. Antony Battiferri, and was born at Urbino in
                1513. She spent her whole life in the study of philosophy
                and polite literature, and is esteemed one of the best Italian poets of the sixteenth century. The principal merit
                of her poems, “<q date="1560">L'Opere Toscane,</q>” <date event="work">1560</date>, consists in a
                noble elevation, their being filled with excellent morals,
                and their breathing a spirit of piety. The academy of Intronati, at Sienna, chose her one of their members. She
                died in November 1589, at seventy-six years of age.</p>

            <p>, a dissenting divine, was born at
                Hinckley in Leicestershire in 1736, and was for many
                years a preacher at Hampstead, near London, and afterwards at Coseley, in Staffordshire, from which he retired
                in his latter days to his native town, where he died June 8,
                1803. He was a man of some learning in biblical criticism,
                as appears by his various publications on theological subjects. He wrote, 1. “<q date="1774">An account of the occasion and
                    design of the positive Institutions of Christianity, extracted
                    from the Scriptures only,</q>” <date event="work">1774</date>, 8vo. 2. “<q date="1776">An essay towards an interpretation of the Prophecies of Daniel, with

                peculiarities in St. Paul’s Epistles; on the prophecies of
                Daniel and St. John, &amp;c. To which are added, some strictures on the prophecies of Isaiah,"<!--*BLOB*--> 1798, 8vo. In this
                work, which is as devoid of elegance of style, as of strength
                of argument, and which shows how far a man may go, to
                whom all established belief is obnoxious, the inspiration of
                the New Testament writers is questioned, the genuineness of the Apocalypse is endeavoured to be invalidated;
                and the evangelical predictions of Isaiah are transferred
                from the Messiah to the political history of our own times.
                The most singular circumstance of the personal history of
                Mr. Amner, was his incurring the displeasure of George
                Steevens, the celebrated commentator on Shakspeare.
                This he probably did very innocently, for Mr. Steevens
                was one of those men who wanted no motives for revenge
                or malignity but what he found in his own breast. He had,
                however, contracted a dislike to Mr. Amner, who was his
                neighbour at Hampstead, and marked him out as the victim of a species of malignity which, we believe, has no
                parallel. This was his writing several notes to the indecent passages in Shakspeare, in a gross and immoral style,
                and placing Mr. Amner’s name to them. These appeared
                first in the edition of 1793, and are still continued.</p>

            <p>, an associate of Luther in the
                reformation, was born in 1483, near Wurtzen in Misnia,
                of a noble family. After studying divinity, he became
                one of the clergy of Wittemberg, and preached also at
                Magdeburgh and Naumburgh. In 1527, he accompanied
                Luther, to whose doctrines he was zealously attached, to
                the diet of Worms, and on his return, was in the same
                carriage with that reformer, when he was seized by order
                f the elector of Saxony, and conducted to Wartburgh. In
                1573, he concurred in drawing up the articles of Smalcalde, and was, in 1542, appointed bishop of Naumburgh
                by the elector John Frederick, who disapproved of the
                choice which the chapter had made of Julius de Pflug.
                But, five years after, when his patron was taken prisoner
                by Charles V. he was obliged to surrender the bishopric
                to Pflug, and retire to Magdeburgh. He afterwards assisted
                in founding the university of Jena, which was intended as
                a rival to that of Wirtemberg, and died at Eisenach,
                May 14, 1565. The principal thing objected to him by
                the popish writers, and by some of his biographers, is,
                that in a dispute with G. Major, he maintained that good
                works were hurtful to salvation: but however improper
                this expression in the heat of debate, it is evident from his
                writings, that he meant that good works impeded salvation
                by being relied on as the cause of it, and that they were
                the fruit and effect of that faith to which pardon is promised. He was one of the boldest in his time in asserting
                the impiety and absurdity of the principal popish doctrines,
                but from his bigotted adherence to Lutheran principles,
                had too little respect for the other reformers who were of
                different sentiments in some points. Moreri is wrong in
                asserting that he formed a sect called by his name. Thesame principles were held by many of the Lutheran
                divinos. He wrote on the “<q>Lord’s Supper,</q>” and some
                other controversial pieces enumerated by JVlelchior Adam,
                Joecher, and Adelung.</p>

            <p>, an eminent French
                actor and dramatic writer, was born at Fontainbleau, Nov.
                1, 1661. He studied in the Jesuits’ college at Paris,
                under father de la Rue; who, discovering in him a remarkable quickness and capacity for learning, was extremely desirous of engaging him in their order, but d'Ancourt’s aversion to a religious life rendered all his efforts
                ineffectual. After he had gone through a course of philosophy, he applied himself to the civil law, and was admitted advocate at seventeen years of age, but falling in
                love with an actress, he went upon the stage; and, in
                1680, married this woman. As he had all the qualifications
                necessary for the theatre, he soon greatly distinguished
                himself, and began to write pieces for the stage, many of
                which had such success, that most of the players grew rich
                from the profits of them. His merit in this way procured
                him a very favourable reception at court, where Lewis <sc>XIV</sc>.
                shewed him many marks of his favour. Ais sprightly conversation and polite behaviour made his company agreeable
                to all the men of figure both at court and in the city, and
                the most considerable persons were extremely pleased to
                have him at their houses. Having taken a journey to
                Dunkirk, to see his eldest daughter who lived there, he
                took the opportunity of paying his compliments to the
                elector of Bavaria, who was then at Brussels. This prince
                received him with the utmost civility; and, having retained
                him a considerable time, dismissed him, with a present of
                a diamond valued at a thousand pistoles; he likewise rewarded him in a very generous manner, when, upon his
                coming to Paris, d'Ancourt composed an entertainment for
                his diversion. At length grown weary of the theatre,
                which he quitted in Lent, 1718, he retired to his estate of
                Courcelles le Roy, in Berry; where he applied himself
                wholly to devotion, and composed a translation of David’s
                psalms in verse, and a sacred tragedy, which were never
                printed. He died the 16th of December, 1726, 65 years
                of age. His plays consist of fifty-two, of which twentyfive are said to keep their reputation on the stage. They
                were published in 1710 and 1750, in 9 vols. 12mo, and the
                best of them in 3 vols. 12mo, under the title of “<q>Chefsd‘œuvre de d’Ancourt.</q>”</p>

            <p>, a learned German, and a member of the Imperial Academy, was born at Hamburgh,
                March 14, 1674. His father was a rich merchant, who
                spared no expence in cultivating his talents, which were
                particularly directed to the study of the canon law, languages, and natural history, which he studied at Halle,
                Leipsic, and Leyden. Soon after his father’s death, in
                1708, he was appointed syndic of the republic of Hamburgh, was employed in various negociations with the
                princ-ipal courts of Europe, and was always eager to make
                himself acquainted with whatever was interesting in the
                countries he visited. On his return in 1725 he was made
                burgomaster, and chief of the city and territory of Hamburgh; a situation which, however, did not interrupt his
                studies, nor his correspondence with the learned of Germany and France. He studied especially the history of
                the northern nations, not contenting himself with what
                had been published, but visited them; and not only acquired more knowledge than books contained, but was
                enabled to separate fabulous reports and traditions from
                genuine authorities. His principal publication was printed
                in 1746, and translated into French at Paris, in 1753, 2
                vols. “<q>Histoire naturelle de Islamic du Groenland, du
                    detroit de Devis, et d‘autres pays situe’s sous le nord, tracluit de l’Amemand de M. Anderson.</q>” He wrote also,

                and “<q>Observationes juris Germanici,</q>” which last remains

                afterwards passed a few years in the principal German and
                Dutch universities. He resided likewise some time in
                England, and formed an acquaintance, in the course of his
                various travels, with the most eminent physicians and chemists of the age. On his return to Hanover, he succeeded
                to his father’s business, who was an apothecary; and published from time to time, in the Hanoverian Magazine,
                many learned and useful dissertations on medical and chemical subjects, and formed a very fine museum of natural
                history; of which, at his death, he left a catalogue raisonne. In 1765, by desire of his Britannic majesty, he
                undertook an examination of the different kinds of earth
                in the electorate of Hanover, and published the result in

            <p>, bishop of Aleria in Corsica, has
                established a name in the literary world, not so much by
                his original compositions, as by the care he bestowed in
                superintending many valuable works, when the invention
                of printing was introduced at Rome, by those celebrated
                printers Conrad Sweignheym, and Arnould Pannartz.
                His family name was Bussi, or Bossi, and he was born at
                Vigevano in 1417: after having resided for many years at,
                Rome in a state of poverty and neglect, he obtained the
                patronage of the cardinal de Cusa, who procured for him
                the place of secretary to the Vatican library, and then the
                bishopric of Accia, in the island of Corsica; from which
                he was translated not long after to that of Aleria. Some
                biographers, mistaking him for John Andreas, the canonist, have attributed to him writings on the Decretals; we
                have nothing of his, however, that can be deemed original,
                except the valuable prefaces prefixed to the editions which
                he corrected and superintended in the press. He died in
                1475. He was particularly instrumental in introducing
                the art of printing into Italy, and fixing it at Rome. The
                printers above-mentioned were under his immediate protection, and in his prefaces he considers them as under
                his care. The works he superintended were, in 1468 9,
                1. Epistolae Ciceronis ad Familiares. 2. Hieronymi Epistolrc. 3. Julius Caesar. 4. Livy. 5. Virgil. 6. Lucan.
                7. Aulus Gellius. 8. Apuleius; and in 1470 1, 9. Lactantius. 10. Cicero’s Orations. 11. S. Biblia. 12. Cyprianus. 13. S. Leon. Mag. Sermones et Epistolne. 14. Ovidii
                Metamorph. 15. Pliny. 16. Quintilian. 17. Suetonius.
                18. Ciceronis Epist. ad Attic; and Lyra in Biblia, and
                Strabo, without date. Mr. Beloe, who has abridged many
                of Andreas’s prefaces, justly observes, that when the
                length of time is considered, which at the present day
                would be required to carry any one of the preceding works
                through the press, it seems astonishing, and hardly credible, that so much should have been accomplished in so
                very short a period.</p>

            <p>, wife to the preceding, was
                born at Padua in 1562, became an actress of great fame,
                and was flattered by the applauses of the men of wit and
                learning in her time. She is described as a woman of elegant figure, beautiful countenance, and melodious voice, of
                taste in her profession, and conversant with the French and
                Spanish languages; nor was she unacquainted with philosophy and the sciences. She was a votary of the muses,
                and cultivated poetry with ardour and success. The Intend, academicians of Pavia, conferred upon her the
                honours of their society, and the titles of Isabella Andreina, Comica Gelosa, Academica Intenta, delta l'Accesa.
                She dedicated her works to cardinal Cinthio Aldobrandini
                (nephew to Clement <sc>VIIL</sc>), by whom she was greatly
                esteemed, and for whom many of her poems were composed.
            </p>
            <p>In France, whither she made a tour, she met with the
                most flattering reception from the king, the queen, and the
                court. She composed several sonnets in praise of her royal
                patrons, which are inserted in the second volume of her
                poems. She married Francis Andreini, whom we have just
                noticed, and died at Lyons, June 10th, 1604, in consequence of a premature delivery during a state of pregnancy,
                in the forty -second year of her age. Her husband, whom
                her loss overwhelmed with affliction, had her interred in
                the city in which she expired, and erected a monument to
                her memory, on which he caused an epitaph to be inscribed, enumerating her virtues, her piety, and her talents. Her death was lamented in many Latin and Italian
                elegies and panegyrics, and even a medal was struck to her
                memory, with the inscription, “<q>JEterna Fama.</q>” The justice of these high praises may still be appreciated by a
                perusal of her works 1. “<q date="1588">Mirtilla, favola pastorale,</q>” Verona, <date event="work">1588</date>, 8vo, and often reprinted. She is said to have
                begun this in her infancy, but it does not appear to have
                been very successful on the stage. 2. “<q date="1601">Rime,</q>” Milan,

            <p>, an eminent Italian musician, wa
                born about the year 1736, and studied his art at Naples
                under the greatest masters. In 1771, Piccini, who had a
                friendship for him, procured him an engagement as composer for the theatre della Dame, at Rome. Here his first
                attempts were not very successful; yet he persisted, and in
                1775, established his reputation completely by his “<q>Inconnue persecutee;</q>” “<q>La Finta Giardiniera;</q>” and “<q>
                    <sc>II</sc>
                    Geloso in cimento;</q>” the merit of all which operas was
                amply acknowledged. The failure, however, of his “<q>Olympiade,</q>” and some other unpleasant circumstances, determined him to travel. Accordingly, he visited the principal cities of Italy, and came to Paris, with the title of
                master of the conservatory at Venice. He presented to
                the royal academy of music his “<q>Inconnue persecutee,</q>”
                adapted to French words, but it had not the same success
                as in Italy. In 1782 he came to London, to take the
                direction of the opera: but, as Dr. Burney observes, he
                arrived at an unfavourable time; for as Sacchini had preceded him, and as the winter folio wing was only rendered
                memorable at the opera-house by misfortunes, disgrace,
                and bankruptcy, his reputation was rather diminished than
                increased in this kingdom. In 1787, he finally settled at
                Rome, where his reputation was at its height, and continued unabated to the day of his death in 1795. Besides
                his operas, he composed some oratorios from words selected by Metastasio.</p>

                Oxford, in 1610. After taking his degrees in arts, he went
                into the church, and became a frequent and popular
                preacher. In 1630 he preached a lecture at Leicester;
                but, in 1634, was suspended by the dean of the arches for
                preaching without a licence. In 1650, the Independents,
                who then were predominant, obliged him to leave Leicester,
                because he refused to subscribe to their engagement. On
                this the Mercers’ company chose him lecturer of Grantham
                in Lincolnshire, where he remained until his death in 1655,

                the last century, was born at Dunkirk in 1685, and visiting
                Flanders and Germany in the course of his studies, made
                the longest stay at Dusseldorpe, enchanted with the treasures of painting in that city. He came to England about
                the year 1712, and soon became a favourite painter; but
                in the year 1728, he set out for Italy, where he spent three
                years. At Rome his pictures gave great satisfaction, but
                being of a reserved temper, and not ostentatious of his
                merit, he disgusted several by the reluctance with which
                he exhibited his works; his studious and sober temper inclining him more to the pursuit of his art than to the advantage of his fortune. Yet his attention to the latter
                prevented his returning to England, as he intended; for,
                stopping at Rennes in Bretagne, a rich and parliamentary
                town, he was so immediately overwhelmed with employment there, that he settled in that city, and died there in a
                short time, in 1734, when he was not above forty nine
                years of age. He executed conversations and landscapes
                with small figures, which he was fond of enriching with representations of fruit and fish. His manner was a mixture
                of Teniers and Watteau, with more grace than the former,
                and more nature than the latter. His pencil was easy,
                bright, and flowing, but his colouring too faint and nerveless. He afterwards adopted the habits of Rubens and
                Vandyck, more picturesque indeed, but not so proper to
                improve his productions in what their chief beauty consisted, familiar life.</p>

                was the younger brother, born in 1612, executed the tomb
                of the grand prior of Souvre, the ornaments on the gate of
                St. Dennis, the figures on the front gate of Val-de-grace,
                Amphitrite, &amp;c. He assisted his brother likewise in some of
                his works, and died in 1686, aged 74. They were both
                buried at St. Koch, where they are honoured with an epitaph.</p>

            <p>, one of the most
                celebrated Italian poets of the sixteenth century, was born
                about 1517, at Sutri in Tuscany, of very poor parents.
                After receiving such education as he could afford, he came
                to Rome and engaged himself as a corrector of the press;
                but an intrigue with his master’s wife, in which he was detected, obliged him to leave Rome^with a little money and
                a few cloaths, of which he was stripped by robbers. He
                then begged his way to Vienna, and there got immediate
                employment from Franceschi, the bookseller; and, while
                with him, wrote his translation of Ovid, and some of his
                original works. He then returned to Rome, which his reputation as a poet had reached, but his misfortunes also
                followed him; and after having lived for some time on the
                sale of his cloaths and books, he died partly of hunger, and
                partly of a disease contracted by his imprudent conduct,
                in an inn near Torre de Nona. The exact date of his
                death is not known, but it appears by a letter addressed to
                him by Annibai Caro, that he was alive in 1564. His
                translation of the Metamorphoses still enjoys a high reputation in Italy, and Varchi and some other critics chuse to
                prefer it to the original. This is exaggerated praise, but
                undoubtedly the poetry and style are easy and elegant;
                although from the many liberties he has taken with the
                text, it ought rather to be called an imitation than a translation. The editions have been numerous, but the best is
                that of the Giunti, Venice, 1584, 4to, with engravings by
                Franco, and notes and arguments by Orologi and Turchi.
                He also began the Æneid, but one book only was printed,
                1564, 4to; soon after which period it is supposed he died.
                His other works are: 1. “<q>CEdipo,</q>” a tragedy, partly original and partly from Sophocles. It had great success in
                representation, and was played in a magnificent temporary
                theatre built for the purpose by Palladio in 1565. 2.
                “<q>Canzoni,</q>” addressed to the dukes of Florence and Ferrara. 3. “<q>Poetical arguments for all the cantos of Orlando
                    Furioso. 4. Four</q>” Capitoli,"<!--*BLOB*--> or satires, printed in various collections of that description. It appears by these
                last that he was gay and thoughtless in the midst of all his
                misfortunes.</p>

            <p>, astronomer, geometrician, and mechanic, was the son of a labourer employed in agriculture.
                He was born Feb. 22, 1723, at Oberperfuss, a village
                about 12 miles from Inspruck, and died Sept. 1, 1766.
                While engaged in the menial employments of labourer
                and shepherd, he felt an irresistible impulse towards astronomy and geometry. Pere Hill, a Jesuit, professor in the
                university of Inspruck, discovered his talents, and enabled
                him to cultivate them with such success, that in a short
                time he became an able astronomer, and one of the best
                mechanics in Europe. He made a pair of globes for the
                university of Inspruck, which are acknowledged to be
                masterpieces in their kind. He constructed and completed
                a great variety of mathematical instruments, and drew
                maps and charts of admirable accuracy and neatness.
                Snatched away in the flower of his age from the arts and
                sciences, he was deservedly lamented by person’s of real
                knowledge. The empress-queen, whose subject he was,
                and who had granted him a pension of 200 florins, which
                he enjoyed but two months, settled a pension of 50 florins
                on his sister, to testify her consideration for the deceased.
                The maps which he left were published at Vienna in 1774,
                “<q date="1767">Tyrolis chorographia delineata e Petro An-ich et BlasioHueber, curante Ign. Weinhart.</q>” His life was published

            <p>, dean of Edinburgh in Scotland,
                the son of William Annand, minister of Air, in Airshire,
                was born in that town in 1633. Five years after, his father
                was obliged to quit Scotland with his family, on account of
                their loyalty to the king, and adherence to the episcopal
                government established by law in that country. In 1651,
                young Annand was admitted a scholar in University -college, Oxford; and though he was put under the care of a
                Presbyterian tutor, yet he took all occasions to be present
                at the sermons preached by the loyal divines in and near
                Oxford. In 1656, being then bachelor of arts, he received holy orders from the hands of Dr. Thomas Fulwar,
                bishop of Ardfert, or Kerry in Ireland; and was appointed
                preacher at Weston on the Green, near Bicester, in Oxfordshire; where he met with great encouragement from
                sir Francis Norris, lord of that manor. After he had taken
                his degree of M. A. he was presented to the vicarage of
                Leighton-Buzzard, in Bedfordshire; where he distinguished
                himself by his edifying manner of preaching, till 1662, when
                he went into Scotland, as chaplain to John earl of Middleton, the king’s high commissioner to the church of that
                kingdom. In the latter end of 1663, he was instituted to
                the Tolbooth church, at Edinburgh; and from thence was
                removed some years after to the Trone church of that
                city, which was likewise a prebend. In April 1676, he was
                nominated by the king to the deanery of Edinburgh; and
                in 1685 he commenced D. D. in the university of St. Andrews. He died June 13, 1689, and was honourably interred in the Grey-friars church at Edinburgh. As his
                life was pious and devout, so his sickness and death afforded great consolation to those who attended him in his
                last moments.

            <p>, confessor to Lewis <sc>XIV</sc>. was born
                at Rouergue, in 1590. He became a Jesuit in 1607, and
                professed the fourth vow in 1624. He taught philosophy at
                Toulouse six years, and divinity seven; and having discharged his duty in each of these capacities with great
                applause, he was invited to Rome, to act as censor-general of the books published by the Jesuits, and theologist to
                the general of the society. Upon his return to his own
                province, he was appointed rector of the colleges of Montpellier and of Toulouse. He assisted as deputy of his
                province at the eighth congregation-general of the Jesuits
                held at Rome in 1645, where he distinguished himself in
                such a manner, that father Vincent Caraffa, general of the
                Jesuits, thought no person more fit to discharge the office
                of assistant of France, which had been vacant for some
                time. The ninth congregation gave him the same post,
                under Francis Picolimini, general of the society, upon
                whose death he was made provincial of the province of
                France. Whilst he was engaged in this employment, he
                was chosen confessor to the king 1654; and after having
                discharged this office 16 years, he was obliged to solicit
                his dismission; his great age having much impaired his
                hearing. Father Sotueil, from whom these particulars are
                taken, gives him the character of a person of great virtues,
                perfect disinterestedness, modesty, and humility; exact in
                practising the observances and discipline of his order; extremely cautious in using his interest for his own advantage, or that of his family; and of uncommon zeal for religion. &lt;. He was the hammer of heretics,“<q>says he,</q>” and attacked particularly, with incredible zeal, the new
                heresy of the Jansenists. He strenuously endeavoured to
                get it condemned by the pope, and restrained by the authority of the king. Besides which, he confuted it with
                such strength of argument, that his adversaries had nothing solid to reply to him."<!--*BLOB*--> There are many (says Mr. Bayle) whom father Sotueil will never convince in this last
                point; but he seems to agree with him in the character of
                disinterestedness which he gives to Annat, who stirred so
                little for the advancement of his family, that the king is
                reported to have said, he knew not whether father Annat
                had any relations.
            </p>
            <p>Father Annat wrote several books, some in Latin, which
                were collected and published in three vols. 4to, Paris,
                1666; and others in bad French, mostly upon the disputes
                between the Jesuits and Jansenists. He died at Paris in
                1670.</p>

            <p>, a very eminent
                nonconformist minister, was the son of John Aneley, of
                Hareley, in Warwickshire, where his family were possessed of a good estate, and was born about the year 1620.
                In 1635 he was admitted a student in Queen’s college, Oxford, where he took his bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
                At the university he was distinguished by extreme temperance and industry. His inclination leading him to the
                church, he received holy orders, but it is uncertain whether from the hands of a bishop, or according to the Presbyterian way; Wood inclines to the former, and Calamy
                to the latter. In 1644, however, he became chaplain to
                the earl of Warwick, then admiral of the parliament’s fleet,
                and afterwards succeeded to a church at Clift'e, in Kent,
                by the ejectment, for loyalty, of Dr. Griffith Higges, who
                was much beloved by his parishioners. On July 26, 1648,
                he preached the fast sermon before the house of commons,
                which, as usual, was ordered to be printed. About this
                time, also, he was honoured with the title of <sc>LL</sc>. D. by
                the university of Oxford, or rather by the peremptory
                command of Philip earl of Pembroke, chancellor of the
                university, who acted there with boundless authority.
                The same year, he went to sea with the earl of Warwick,
                who was employed in giving chase to that part of the
                English navy which went over to the then prince, afterwards king Charles <sc>II</sc>. Some time after this, he resigned
                his Kentish living, although he had now become popular
                there, in consequence of a promise he made to his parishioners to “<q date="1657">resign it when he had fitted them for the
                    reception of a better minister.</q>” In <date event="work">1657</date>, he was nominated by Cromwell, lecturer at St. Paul’s; and in 1658
                was presented by Richard, the protector, to the vicarage
                of St. Giles’s, Cripplegate. But this presentation becoming soon useless, he, in 1660, procured another from
                the trustees for the approbation and admission of ministers
                of the gospel, after the Presbyterian manner. His second
                presentation growing out of date as the first, he obtained,
                in the same year, a third, of a more legal stamp, from
                Charles <sc>II</sc>.; but in 1662, he was ejected for nonconformity. He was offered considerable preferment, if he
                would conform, but refused it, and continued to preach
                privately during that and the following reign. He died
                in 1696, with a high reputation for piety, charity, and
                popular talents. His works, which are enumerated by
                Calamy, consist of occasional sermons, and some funeral
                sermons, with biographical memoirs. He was the principal support, if not the institutor, of the morning lecture,
                or course of sermons preached at seven o'clock in the
                morning, at various churches, during the usurpation, and
                afterwards at meeting-houses, by the most learned and
                able nonconformists. Of these several volumes have been
                printed, and of late years have risen very much in price.
                Collectors inform us that a complete set should consist of
                six volumes.</p>

                to Paris, and acquired great fame in that metropolis by
                his sermons, and especially by his funeral orations. It
                was observed, however, that although elegant in style,
                they wanted much of that fervency which touches the
                heart. His noble pupil caused to be revived the place of
                historian of buildings, and bestowed it on Anselme; and
                the Academy of Painting, and that of Inscriptions and
                belles lettres, admitted him a member. Towards the
                close of life he retired to the abbey of St. Severe in Gascony, where he enjoyed the pleasures which his books and
                his garden afforded, and became a public benefactor;
                projecting new roads, decorating churches, founding hospitals,
                and by his discreet interposition, adjusting the differences which fell out among the country people. He died
                Aug. 18, 1737, in his ninety-sixth year. His works are a
                collection of “<q>Sermons, Panegyriques, &amp; Oraisontj Funebres,</q>” 7 vols. 8vo. The “<q>Sermons</q>” have been reprinted
                in 6 vols. 12mo. He has also several “<q>Dissertations</q>” in
                the Memoirs of the Academy of Inscriptions, from the
                year 1724 to 1729.</p>

                In 1649 he travelled to Italy, where he acquired great reputation as a writer of Latin verse. Pope Innocent X.
                gave him a beautiful medal for a poem which he had composed on occasion of the jubilee celebrated in 165O, and
                queen Christina gave him a gold chain for a poem in Dutch
                which he addressed to her. Some have discovered in his
                poems an inclination for the Roman catholic religion. He
                died at Perouse in Italy, May 16, 1669. The collection
                of his works was printed at Rotterdam, 1715, 8vo; and
                contains the “<q date="1646">Crown of St. Stephen the martyr,</q>” published in <date event="work">1646</date>; and his tragedy of the “<q date="1649">Parisian nuptials,

                Sixteenth century, was born at Mantua, about the &gt; r ear 1473.
                Afcer learning Greek as far as it could be taught in his own,
                country, he went into Greece, and improved his acquaintance with that language under the ablest masters during a
                residence there of five years, and wrote and spoke Greek
                as easily as Latin or Italian. On his return to Mantua, he
                engaged in teaching the Greek language, and lectured on
                that and on Greek literature. In 1532 he was invited to
                Feirara, where he became professor of the same studies,
                and held the office until his death in 1552. He translated
                Gemistus Plethon, and part of Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
	&amp;c. under the title “<q date="1540">Gemisti Plethonis de gestis Gnecorum post pugnam ad Mantineam per capita tractatio duobus
                    libris explicata, M. Antonio Antimacho interprete. Ad haec
                    Dionysii Halicarnassei prcccepta, &amp;c.</q>” Bale, <date event="work">1540</date>, 4to.
                He wrote also many Latin poems, which are mostly unpublished. Some have attributed to him eight books of Greek
                epigrams, and there are several by him, both in Greek
                and Latin, in a collection of letters addressed to Vettori,
                and published by Bandini, at Pavia, 1753.</p>
